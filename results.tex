\subsection{Analysis Strategy}\label{analysis-strategy}}

To test our hypotheses that gender role beliefs and religion moderate the relationship between housework distribution and satisfaction, we used multilevel modeling and the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; THIS NEEDS TO BE A REAL CITATION SO THERE IS A BIBLIOGRAPHY Kenny, Kashy, \& Cook, 2006). The APIM measures the effect of the explanatory variables for both members in a dyad at the same time, so actor as well as partner effects could be considered in our analysis. This way, it is possible to see how one partner's housework distribution effects both their own satisfaction with the housework distribution (actor effect) and their partner's satisfaction with the housework distribution (partner effect). In this analysis, we will further look at the moderating effect of each partner's gender role beliefs on the two actor effects (shown in figure 1) as well as on the partner effects. (THIS FOLLOWING SENTENCE CONFUSES ME!) The APIM measures proportion of variance in satisfaction that occurs between dyads vs.~the total variation present. In other words, the model considers how much of the variation in satisfaction is caused by the dyad. This allows to estimate satisfaction with the distribution of housework as a function of both housework distribution and the the random errors at both the individual and dyad level. This accounts for the non-independent data.

\subsubsection{Gender Role Beliefs as a mediator}\label{gender-role-beliefs-as-a-mediator}}

All relevant results of the moderation analysis in the APIM are shown in figure 2. It was shown that for husbands and wives, a higher amount of housework was significantly related to a lower satisfaction (INCLUDE P VALUES).
For women, gender role beliefs significantly moderated the relationship between her own housework distribution and satisfaction with the housework distribution. The moderation effect was 0.07 (\emph{p} = 0.00, SE = 0.02). Higher, which mean more conservative, gender role beliefs were therefore associated with a higher satisfaction when the amount of housework was kept constant. Not only the wife's gender role beliefs but also the husband's gender role beliefs significantly moderated the relationship between the wife's housework distribution and her satisfaction with the housework distribution. The moderation effect was -0.06 (\emph{p} = 0.01, SE = 0.02). When the husbands had more conservative gender role beliefs, the wife's satisfaction decreased by -0.06 while keeping housework distribution constant.
Moreover, a moderation effect was found for the relationship between the husbands amount of housework and the wife's satisfaction which was moderated by the husband's gender role beliefs. More conservative gender role beliefs were associated with lower satisfaction when housework distribution was held constant (INCLUDE NUMBERS).
All other paths were not significantly related to each other (INCLUDE LOWEST OF ALL NONSIGN. P VALUES HERE, AND THEN \emph{p} \textgreater{} \ldots)



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=4.25in]{moderation} \caption{Moderation effects in the APIM. Values shown in the figure are uncorrected b coefficients (PLEASE TRY TO FIND WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN, I AM LOST).}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-9}
\end{figure}

(I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS SENTENCE/SECTION. WHAT IS DESCRIBED HERE? THAT MUST BE CLEAR AND RELATED TO A FIGURE ETC.) Only looking at the three way interactions with gender we found two significant gender differences in the moderation effects. The interaction between actors housework distribution and their own gender role beliefs was significantly different for husbands and wives with an estimate of 0.06 (\emph{p} = 0.03, SE =0.03). The moderation effect of ones own gender role beliefs was 0.06 units higher for women than men meaning the moderation effect of gender role beliefs had a significantly larger positive effect on satisfaction for wives than for husbands.

In addition the interaction between actors housework distribution and their partners gender role beliefs was significantly different for husbands and wives with an estimate of -0.08(\emph{p} = 0.01, SE = 0.03).The moderation effect of ones partners gender role beliefs was -0.08 units lower for women than men meaning the moderation effect of her husbands gender role beliefs had a significantly larger negative effect on satisfaction compared to how her gender role beliefs effected the relationship between housework distribution and satisfaction for her husband.

\end{figure}



Wives who have low gender role beliefs, which means they are more liberal, reported a lower satisfaction with an increasing amount of housework they had to do. Women with more conservative gender role beliefs (high) did not show a significant decrease in satisfaction with an increasing amount of housework (figure 3).

\end{figure}

As the housework distribution increases for wives whose husbands have low gender role beliefs, their satisfaction remains constant. As the housework distribution increases for wives whose husbands have high gender role beliefs, their satisfaction decreases (figure 4).

\hypertarget{religion}{%
\subsubsection{Religion}\label{religion}}

The two intercept model gives us the two coefficients for men and women.

None of the interactions between actors housework distribution and their religion was significantly different for husbands or wives. (\emph{p}\textgreater=0.19,\emph{se}=0.08). None of the results illustrate that the average female-typed tasks completed by the actor or partner from the husband and wife's perspective was related to their religion.

\hypertarget{exploratory-results}{%
\subsection{Exploratory Results}\label{exploratory-results}}

Mediation is a way for researchers to explain the process of one variable affecting another variable. It is essentially a possible explanation for the relationship between the two variables. Mediation assesses whether the effects of the X variable (the independent variable) are significant on the Y variable (the dependent variable), through a third variable called M (the mediator).

Based on our primary analysis so far, we are interested in further exploring how to concept of gatekeeping fits into our research. We want to explore whether gatekeeping is a mediator variable in our relationship between the partners' gender role beliefs and housework tasks. Are women with higher gender role beliefs more likely to gatekeep housework tasks?

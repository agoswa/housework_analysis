These questions are related, as some scholars propose that religion has evolved to enhance altruistic behavior toward members of one’s group. I review here data from survey studies (both within and across countries), priming experiments, and correlational studies of the effects of religion on racial prejudice. I conclude that religion has powerfully good moral effects and powerfully bad moral effects, but these are due to aspects of religion that are shared by other human practices. There is surprisingly little evidence for a moral effect of speciﬁcally religious beliefs.},

	abstract = {Research has found that intergenerational transmission of religiosity results in higher family functioning and improved family relationships. Yet the Pew Research Center found that 44\% of Americans reported that they had left the religious afﬁliation of their childhood. And 78\% of the expanding group of those who identify as religiously unafﬁliated (“Nones”) reported that they were raised in “highly religious families.” We suggest that this may be, in part, associated with religious parents exercising excessive ﬁrmness with inadequate ﬂexibility (rigidity). We used a multiphase, systematic, team-based process to code 8000+ pages of in-depth interviews from 198 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim families from 17 states in all 8 major religio-cultural regions of the United States. We framed ﬁrmness as mainly about loyalty to God and God’s purposes, and ﬂexibility as mainly about loyalty to family members and their needs and circumstances. The reported ﬁndings provided a range of examples illustrating (a) religious ﬁrmness, (b) religious ﬂexibility, as well as (c) efforts to balance and combine ﬁrmness and ﬂexibility. We discuss conceptual and practical implications of treating ﬁrmness and ﬂexibility as complementary loyalties in intergenerational faith transmission.},

The authors explore whether religious conservatism affects work–family outcomes of men using the National Survey of Families and Households, 1988 and 1993 waves. The authors hypothesize that men from conservative households will make earlier transitions to adulthood, work fewer hours, and earn less money. Moreover, the belief in strong paternal involvement should lead religiously conservative men to spend more time in housework and child care. Results show that conservative religious affiliation does not hasten the transition to adulthood among men. Current religious conservatism results in lower wages but not reduced work hours, and religious affiliation does not affect housework or child care.},

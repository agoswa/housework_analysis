            Past research reveals the multiple ways that people grapple with the connections between religious and sexual identities. Some people perceive religious identities to be in conflict with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer ({LGBQ}) identities, but others believe such identities to be compatible. Some people look to religious authorities for guidance in understanding the connections between religious and {LGBQ} identities, whereas others rely on strategies of religious individualism. What factors affect people’s approaches to understanding the connections between religious and sexual identities? Drawing on 77 interviews with participants in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer ({LGBTQ}) activist groups at four Christian colleges and universities, and employing Goffmanian insights, this article shows how {LGBTQ} activist groups’ different audiences inspire distinct approaches to understanding religion and sexuality. The study demonstrates that activist groups can powerfully shape understandings of seemingly disparate social identities and suggests a theoretical framework for future research.},

	abstract = {The article offers a critical analysis of the cognitive science of religion ({CSR}) as applied to new and quasireligious movements, and uncovers implicit conceptual and theoretical commitments of the approach. A discussion of {CSR}’s application to new religious movement ({NRM}) case studies (charismatic leadership, paradise representations, Aḥmadiyya, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness) identifies concerns about the theorized relationship between {CSR} and wider socio-cultural factors, and proposals for {CSR}’s implication in wider processes are discussed. The main discussion analyses three themes in recent work relating {CSR} to religious and religion-like activities that extend and reframe the model. These include (1) identification of distinctive and accessible cognitive pathways associated with new forms of religious belief and practice (in particular in ‘New Age’ movements), (2) application of {CSR} to movements and practices outside traditional definitions of religion (near death experiences, conspiracy theories, virtual reality), and (3) engaging {CSR} in wider cultural processes and negotiations (religion in healthcare settings, and the definition of the study of esoteric religious traditions within academic domains). The conclusion identifies two particular findings: (1) that application of {CSR} in these areas renders underlying cognitive processes more available to scrutiny and (2) that {CSR} is employed to identify and enlarge the category of religion. The conclusion suggests that the study of {CSR} in its application to {NRMs} and quasi-religion identifies a wide field of common and overlapping themes and interests in which {CSR} is a more active operand than is commonly assumed.},

A subset of this research has explored if the adverse influence of misinformation on remembering can be undone or at least reduced through a later warning about its presence. We metaanalyzed 25 such post-warning studies (including 155 effect sizes) to determine the effectiveness of different types of warnings and to explore moderator effects. Key findings were that (1) post-warnings are surprisingly effective, reducing the misinformation effect to less than half of its size on average. (2) Some types of post-warning (following a theoretical classification) seem to be more effective than others, particularly studies using an enlightenment procedure (Blank, 1998). (3) The post-warning reduction in the misinformation effect reflects a specific increase in misled performance (relative to no warning), at negligible cost for control performance. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications.},

However, much of this research has exposed participants to misinformation first then provided a correction, and used indirect memory questions. Using a misinformation effect ({ME}) paradigm, in which participants' memory is distorted by misleading postevent information, we examine whether corrections can combat memory distortion on direct memory tests. Experiment 1 showed corrections greatly reduced the {ME}. Experiment 2 replicated this finding with a longer lag time (3 min) between exposure to misinformation and its correction, except for participants that read only the misinformation and its correction. Experiment 3 ruled out the possibility that participants reported the most recent information they read, suggesting participants evaluate the correction's veracity. Finally, a meta‐analysis of the three experiments reiterates that corrections may be effective in combating misinformation.},

Neither left nor right 2D:4D digit ratio was associated with any sensation-seeking scale. In multivariate models, salivary T and facial masculinity were signiﬁcant predictors of {SSS} boredom susceptibility, while 7R+ was a signiﬁcant predictor of {SSS} thrill and adventure-seeking. For overall {SSS}, both 7R+ and salivary T were signiﬁcant predictors. There was no signiﬁcant interaction of 7R+ and androgen exposure for {SSS} or any of the {SSS} subscales. These results add to earlier reports of an association between T and sensation-seeking.

Many factors of individual differences further moderate the impact of misinformation. The experiment reported here attempts to explore the effects of post event information on recognition accuracy of witnessed events, as moderated by the arousal states of energetic arousal, tense arousal, hedonic tone and anger/frustration. Experiment used those participants who scored high on four arousal states and average on rest of the three arousal states. Participants viewed a video clip, depicting a murder, followed by presentation of one week delayed post event information and recognition test for details of the event. Results indicated that participants who were misled retained less number of details of the event than did the participants who were given either consistent or no post event information. High scorer energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants retained more details of the event than did the high scorer tense arousal and anger/frustration participants under all the three post event information conditions. However, high tense arousal and anger/frustration participants’ eyewitness retention dropped more sharply when they were given misleading post event information in comparison to the high energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants. Thus, results of the study indicated a moderating effect of post event information by the arousal states.},

Although research substantiates the beneﬁts of Verhältnis rapport-building on the accuracy of child witness reports, few studies have examined whether similar beneﬁts apply to adult witnesses. The present study investigated whether verbal rapport-building techniques increase adult witness report accuracy and decrease their susceptibility to post-event misinformation. One-hundred eleven college adults viewed a videotaped mock-crime, received post-event misinformation (or correct information) about the crime, and were subsequently interviewed by a research assistant who built rapport (or did not build rapport) before recalling the mock-crime. Results indicated that rapport-building increased the quality of witness recall by decreasing the percentage of inaccurate and misinformation reported, particularly in response to open-ended questions.

Many factors of individual differences further moderate the impact of misinformation. The experiment reported here attempts to explore the effects of post event information on recognition accuracy of witnessed events, as moderated by the arousal states of energetic arousal, tense arousal, hedonic tone and anger/frustration. Experiment used those participants who scored high on four arousal states and average on rest of the three arousal states. Participants viewed a video clip, depicting a murder, followed by presentation of one week delayed post event information and recognition test for details of the event. Results indicated that participants who were misled retained less number of details of the event than did the participants who were given either consistent or no post event information. High scorer energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants retained more details of the event than did the high scorer tense arousal and anger/frustration participants under all the three post event information conditions. However, high tense arousal and anger/frustration participants’ eyewitness retention dropped more sharply when they were given misleading post event information in comparison to the high energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants. Thus, results of the study indicated a moderating effect of post event information by the arousal states.},

	abstract = {Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that stress may orchestrate the engagement of multiple memory systems in the brain. In particular, stress is thought to favor dorsal striatum-dependent procedural over hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects of stress remain elusive, especially in humans. Here, we targeted the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor ({MR}) in the stress-induced modulation of dorsal striatal and hippocampal memory systems in the human brain using a combination of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacologic blockade of the {MR}.
Methods: Eighty healthy participants received the {MR} antagonist spironolactone (300 mg) or a placebo and underwent a stressor or control manipulation before they performed, in the scanner, a classiﬁcation task that can be supported by the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum.
Results: Stress after placebo did not affect learning performance but reduced explicit task knowledge and led to a relative increase in the use of more procedural learning strategies. At the neural level, stress promoted striatum-based learning at the expense of hippocampus-based learning. Functional connectivity analyses showed that this shift was associated with altered coupling of the amygdala with the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade before stress prevented the stress-induced shift toward dorsal striatal procedural learning, same as the stress-induced alterations of amygdala connectivity with hippocampus and dorsal striatum, but resulted in signiﬁcantly impaired performance.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings indicate that the stress-induced shift from hippocampal to dorsal striatal memory systems is mediated by the amygdala, required to preserve performance after stress, and dependent on the {MR}.},

	abstract = {It is commonly assumed that stress impairs memory retrieval. Glucocorticoids, released with a delay of several minutes in response to stressful experiences, are thought to play a key role in the stress-induced retrieval impairment. Accordingly, most studies on the impact of stress on retrieval tested memory a considerable time after stressor exposure, when glucocorticoid levels were elevated. Here, we asked how stress affects memory when retrieval takes place under stress, that is, when stress is part of the retrieval situation and glucocorticoids are not yet increased at the time of testing. To contrast stress effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, 72 participants learned ﬁrst neutral and emotional material. Twenty-four hours later, half of the learned material was tested either in a stressful, oral examination-like testing situation or in a standard, non-stressful free recall test. Memory for the other half of the learned material was assessed 25 min after the ﬁrst, stressful or non-stressful retention test. Signiﬁcant increases in blood pressure and salivary cortisol conﬁrmed the stress induction by the ﬁrst, examination-like testing situation. Retrieval performance under stress was positively correlated with the blood pressure response to the stressor but unaffected by cortisol. Conversely, retrieval performance 25 min post stress was negatively correlated with the cortisol response to the stressor, particularly for emotional items. These results suggest that the same stressor may have opposite effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, depending on the presence of autonomic arousal and glucocorticoids.},

Clinical trials have provided the first evidence that glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies aimed at attenuating aversive memories might be helpful in the treatment of fear-related disorders.

	abstract = {Glucocorticoid stress hormones are crucially involved in modulating mnemonic processing of emotionally arousing experiences. They enhance the consolidation of new memories, including those that extinguish older memories, but impair the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory. As strong aversive memories lie at the core of several fear-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias, the memory-modulating properties of glucocorticoids have recently become of considerable translational interest. Clinical trials have provided the first evidence that glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies aimed at attenuating aversive memories might be helpful in the treatment of fear-related disorders. Here, we review important advances in the understanding of how glucocorticoids mediate stress effects on memory processes, and discuss the translational potential of these new conceptual insights.},

Stress systems communicate threats to the entire organism, and as such, also stimulate inﬂammatory mechanisms. This modulation might serve protective functions in the short term, but sustained low-grade inﬂammation has severe long-term health consequences. While we have reached a reasonable level of understanding of acute, as well as chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammatory mechanisms, there is a signiﬁcant gap in our understanding of the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. The purpose of this review is to ﬁrst summarize current knowledge of our understanding of acute stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, as well as of chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, and to then analyze the state of knowledge about the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. Research discussed here shows that we are beginning to understand the early phase of repeated acute stress, but lack information on longer term exposure to repeated acute stress experiences. More research is needed to bridge this important gap und our conceptualization and understanding of the stress and health relationship.},

In this respect the stress associated increase in activity of the sympathetic nervous system ({SNS}) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis are key. A special focus will be placed on ﬁndings obtained with the Trier Social Stress Test ({TSST}). This paradigm can be used to induce stress before or after a memory task. It was shown repeatedly that stress enhances long-term consolidation but impairs long term memory retrieval. However the {TSST} can also be used to assess memories of this stressful episode itself. The latter requires a standardized presentation of relevant stimuli during the {TSST} as well as a carefully designed control condition. Moreover special care has to be taken to control potential inﬂuences on visual exploration and working memory in order to correctly interpret observed eﬀects on memory. The results obtained so far ﬁt to the idea of enhanced encoding of salient information under stress. These ﬁndings are of relevance for educational, organizational and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Stress activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal ({HPA}) axis culminates in increased circulating corticosteroid concentrations. Stress-induced corticosteroids exert diverse actions in multiple target tissues over a broad range of timescales, ranging from rapid actions, which are induced within seconds to minutes and gene transcription independent, to slow actions, which are delayed, long lasting, and transcription dependent. Rapid corticosteroid actions in the brain include, among others, a fast negative feedback mechanism responsible for shutting down the activated {HPA} axis centrally. We provide a brief review of the cellular mechanisms responsible for rapid corticosteroid actions in different brain structures of the rat, including the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and in the anterior pituitary. We propose a model for the direct feedback inhibition of the {HPA} axis by glucocorticoids in the hypothalamus. According to this model, glucocorticoids activate membrane glucocorticoid receptors to induce endocannabinoid synthesis in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus ({PVN}) and retrograde cannabinoid type I receptormediated suppression of the excitatory synaptic drive to {PVN} neuroendocrine cells. Rapid corticosteroid actions in the hippocampus, amygdala, and pituitary are mediated by diverse cellular mechanisms and may also contribute to the rapid negative feedback regulation of the {HPA} neuroendocrine axis as well as to the stress regulation of emotional and spatial memory formation.},

	abstract = {The hormones and other physiological agents that mediate the effects of stress on the body have protective and adaptive effects in the short run and yet can accelerate pathophysiology when they are over-produced or mismanaged. Here we consider the protective and damaging effects of these mediators as they relate to the immune system and brain. ‘Stress’ is a principle focus, but this term is rather imprecise. Therefore, the article begins by noting two new terms, allostasis and allostatic load that are intended to supplement and clarify the meanings of ‘stress’ and ‘homeostasis’. For the immune system, acute stress enhances immune function whereas chronic stress suppresses it. These effects can be beneﬁcial for some types of immune responses and deleterious for others. A key mechanism involves the stress–hormone dependent translocation of immune cells in the blood to tissues and organs where an immune defense is needed. For the brain, acute stress enhances the memory of events that are potentially threatening to the organism. Chronic stress, on the other hand, causes adaptive plasticity in the brain, in which local neurotransmitters as well as systemic hormones interact to produce structural as well as functional changes, involving the suppression of ongoing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and remodelling of dendrites in the Ammon’s horn. Under extreme conditions only does permanent damage ensue. Adrenal steroids tell only part of the story as far as how the brain adapts, or shows damage, and local tissue modulators — cytokines for the immune response and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters for the hippocampus. Moreover, comparison of the effects of experimenter-applied stressors and psychosocial stressors show that what animals do to each other is often more potent than what experimenters do to them. And yet, even then, the brain is resilient and capable of adaptive plasticity. Stress-induced structural changes in brain regions such as the hippocampus have clinical ramiﬁcations for disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and individual differences in the aging process. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Background: The inability to store fearful memories into their original encoding context is considered to be an important vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder. Altered memory contextualization most likely involves effects of the stress hormone cortisol, acting via receptors located in the memory neurocircuitry. Cortisol via these receptors induces rapid nongenomic effects followed by slower genomic effects, which are thought to modulate cognitive function in opposite, complementary ways. Here, we targeted these time-dependent effects of cortisol during memory encoding and tested subsequent contextualization of emotional and neutral memories.
Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 64 men were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) received 10 mg hydrocortisone 30 minutes (rapid cortisol effects) before a memory encoding task; 2) received 10 mg hydrocortisone 210 minutes (slow cortisol) before a memory encoding task; or 3) received placebo at both times. During encoding, participants were presented with neutral and emotional words in unique background pictures. Approximately 24 hours later, context dependency of their memories was assessed.
Results: Recognition data revealed that cortisol’s rapid effects impair emotional memory contextualization, while cortisol’s slow effects enhance it. Neutral memory contextualization remained unaltered by cortisol, irrespective of the timing of the drug.
Conclusions: This study shows distinct time-dependent effects of cortisol on the contextualization of speciﬁcally emotional memories. The results suggest that rapid effects of cortisol may lead to impaired emotional memory contextualization, while slow effects of cortisol may confer protection against emotional memory generalization.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that cortisol affects learning and memory processes. Despite a wealth of research dedicated to cortisol effects on learning and memory, the strength or even directionality of the effects often vary. A number of the factors that alter cortisol’s effects on learning and memory are well-known. For instance, effects of cortisol can be modulated by emotional arousal and the memory phase under study. Despite great advances in understanding factors that explain variability in cortisol’s effects, additional modulators of cortisol effects on memory exist that are less widely acknowledged in current basic experimental research. The goal of the current review is to disseminate knowledge regarding less well-known modulators of cortisol effects on learning and memory. Since several models for the aetiology of anxiety, such as post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), incorporate stress and the concomitant release of cortisol as important vulnerability factors, enhanced understanding of mechanisms by which cortisol exerts beneficial as opposed to detrimental effects on memory is very important. Further elucidation of the factors that modulate (or alter) cortisol’s effects on memory will allow reconciliation of seemingly inconsistent findings in the basic and clinical literatures. The present review is based on a symposium as part of the 42nd International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology Conference, New York, {USA}, that highlighted some of those modulators and their underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {At the core of anxiety disorders is the inability to use contextual information to modulate behavioral responses to potentially threatening events. Models of the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders incorporate stress and concomitant stress hormones as important vulnerability factors, while others emphasize sex as an important factor. However, translational basic research has not yet investigated the effects of stress hormones and sex on the ability to use contextual information to modulate responses to threat. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was threefold: ﬁrst, we aimed at developing an experimental paradigm speciﬁcally capable of capturing contextual modulation of the expression of fear. Second, we tested whether cortisol would alter the contextualization of fear expression. Third, we aimed at assessing whether alterations in contextualization due to cortisol were different for men and women. Healthy participants (n = 42) received placebo or hydrocortisone (20 mg) prior to undergoing a newly developed differential contextual fear-conditioning paradigm. The results indicated that people rapidly acquire differential contextual modulation of the expression of fear, as measured by fear potentiated startle ({FPS}) and skin conductance responses ({SCR}). In addition, cortisol impaired the contextualization of fear expression leading to increased fear generalization on {FPS} data in women. The opposite pattern was found in men. Finally, as assessed by {SCR}, cortisol impaired differential conditioning in men. The results are in line with models suggesting heightened vulnerability in women for developing anxiety disorders after stressful events.},

Clinical trials have provided the first evidence that glucocorticoid-based pharmacotherapies aimed at attenuating aversive memories might be helpful in the treatment of fear-related disorders.

	abstract = {Objective(s): Due to the prevalence and pervasiveness of stress in modern life and exposure to both chronic and acute stresses, it is not clear whether prior exposure to chronic stress can influence the impairing effects of acute stress on memory retrieval. This issue was tested in this study. Materials and Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: control, acute, chronic, and chronic + acute stress groups. The rats were trained with six trials per day for 6 consecutive days in the water maze. Following training, the rats were either kept in control conditions or exposed to chronic stress in a restrainer 6 hr/day for 21 days. On day 22, a probe test was done to measure memory retention. Time spent in target and opposite areas, platform location latency, and proximity were used as indices of memory retention. To induce acute stress, 30 min before the probe test, animals received a mild footshock.
Results: Stressed animals spent significantly less time in the target quadrant and more time in the opposite quadrant than control animals. Moreover, the stressed animals showed significantly increased platform location latency and proximity as compared with control animals. No significant differences were found in these measures among stress exposure groups. Finally, both chronic and acute stress significantly increased corticosterone levels.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that both chronic and acute stress impair memory retrieval similarly. Additionally, the impairing effects of chronic stress on memory retrieval were not influenced by acute stress.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called {REMERGE} (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; {McClelland}, {McNaughton}, \& O’Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen \& Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory ({McClelland} et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization—as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.},

We ﬁrst describe the history of the studies on the eﬀects of using exogenous stress hormones such as glucocorticoids as anti-inﬂammatory medications on human cognition and mental health. Here, we summarize the cases that led to the diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced ‘steroid psychosis’ in human populations and which demonstrated that these stress hormones could thus cross the blood–brain barrier and access the brain where they could inﬂuence cognition and mental health. We then summarize studies that assessed the eﬀects of the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance supported by the hippocampus, the frontal lobes and amygdala. In the second section of the paper, we summarize the eﬀects of the endogenous release of glucocorticoids induced by exposure to a stressful situation on human cognition and we further dissociate the eﬀects of emotion from those of stress on human learning and memory. Finally, in the last section of the paper, we discuss the potential impact that the environmental context to which we expose participants when assessing their memory could have on their reactivity to stress and subsequent cognitive performance. In order to make our point, we discuss the ﬁeld of memory and aging and we suggest that some of the ‘age-related memory impairments’ observed in the literature could be partly due to increased stress reactivity in older adults to the environmental context of testing. We also discuss the inverse negative correlations reported between hippocampal volume and memory for young and older adults and suggest that these inverse correlations could be partly due to the eﬀects of contextual stress in young and older adults, as a function of age-related diﬀerences in hippocampal volume.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal memory system is thought to alternate between two opposing processing states: encoding and retrieval. When present experience overlaps with past experience, this creates a potential tradeoff between encoding the present and retrieving the past. This tradeoff may be resolved by memory integration—that is, by forming a mnemonic representation that links present experience with overlapping past experience. Here, we used {fMRI} decoding analyses to predict when—and establish how—past and present experiences become integrated in memory. In an initial experiment, we alternately instructed subjects to adopt encoding, retrieval or integration states during overlapping learning. We then trained across-subject pattern classifiers to ‘read out’ the instructed processing states from {fMRI} activity patterns. We show that an integration state was clearly dissociable from encoding or retrieval states. Moreover, trial-by-trial fluctuations in decoded evidence for an integration state during learning reliably predicted behavioral expressions of successful memory integration. Strikingly, the decoding algorithm also successfully predicted specific instances of spontaneous memory integration in an entirely independent sample of subjects for whom processing state instructions were not administered. Finally, we show that medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus differentially contribute to encoding, retrieval, and integration states: whereas hippocampus signals the tradeoff between encoding vs. retrieval states, medial prefrontal cortex actively represents past experience in relation to new learning.},

While we have reached a reasonable level of understanding of acute, as well as chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammatory mechanisms, there is a signiﬁcant gap in our understanding of the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. The purpose of this review is to ﬁrst summarize current knowledge of our understanding of acute stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, as well as of chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, and to then analyze the state of knowledge about the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. Research discussed here shows that we are beginning to understand the early phase of repeated acute stress, but lack information on longer term exposure to repeated acute stress experiences. More research is needed to bridge this important gap und our conceptualization and understanding of the stress and health relationship.},

	abstract = {Objective: Life stress is hypothesized to alter the dynamic regulation of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune systems. This study examined the effects of antecedent chronic life stress on psychological and physiological responsivity after acute challenge with a psychological stressor. Method: Using a within-subject mixed design, male volunteers with [N = 12) and without chronic life stress (N = 11) were administered a 12-minute laboratory stressor (mental arithmetic) vs a video control. Results: Acute psychological stress induced subjective distress, increases of circulating concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, /3-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}), and cortisol, and a selective redistribution of natural killer ({NK}) cells into the peripheral blood as compared with the video control condition. Although the two groups were almost identical at baseline in psychological, sympathetic, neuroendocrine, and immune domains, the chronic stress group showed greater subjective distress, higher peak levels of epinephrine, lower peak levels of /3-endorphin and of {NK} cell lysis, and a more pronounced redistribution of {NK} cells in response to the acute psychological challenge than the controls. Furthermore, the acute stressor induced a protracted decline in {NK} lysis per {NK} cell in the chronic stress group but had no effect in the controls. Conclusions: In summary, when persons who are undergoing chronic life stress are confronted with an acute psychological challenge, an exaggerated psychologic and peak sympathomedullary reactivity occurs that is associated with decrements in individual {NK} cell function and is protracted beyond termination of the stressor and sympathomedullary recovery.},

Relative to women, men had high diastolic blood pressure ({DBF}) responses to the tasks and high {SBP}, {DBF}, and E responses during recovery.

Male C57BL/6J mice that had been repeatedly exposed to rats (‘‘rat stress”) used in a circular hole board task signiﬁcantly more often a stimulus-response strategy (33\%) than control mice (0\%). While velocity was increased, differences in latency to exit hole, distance moved or number of holes visited were not observed. Increased velocity and performance during retention trials one day later indicates altered emotionality and motivation to explore in rat stressed mice. Forty healthy young men and women were split into ‘‘high chronic stress” and ‘‘low chronic stress” groups based on their answers in a chronic stress questionnaire (‘‘Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress”—{TICS}) and trained in a 2D task. A test trial immediately after training revealed that participants of the ‘‘high chronic stress” group used the S-R strategy signiﬁcantly more often (94\%) than participants of the ‘‘low chronic stress” group (52\%). Verbal self-reports conﬁrmed the strategy derived from participants’ choice in the test trial. Learning performance was unaffected by the chronic stress level. We conclude that one consequence of chronic stress is the shift to more rigid stimulus-response learning, that is accompanied by changes in motivational factors in mice.},

This review summarizes the ﬁndings that have emerged from older populations as 28 well as from populations suffering from pathological aging, namely Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alz- 29 heimer’s disease. Although older adults are an interesting population to study in terms of chronic stress, 30 other stress-related diseases can occur throughout the lifespan. The second section covers some of these 31 stress-related diseases that have recently received a great deal of attention, namely burnout, depression, 32 and post-traumatic stress disorder. Given that chronic stress contributes to the development of certain 33 pathologies by accelerating and/or exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities that vary from one individual 34 to the other, the ﬁnal section summarizes data obtained on potential variables contributing to the asso- 35 ciation between chronic stress and cognition.},

	abstract = {Patients on sick leave due to work-related stress often complain about impaired concentration and memory. However, it is undetermined how widespread these impairments are, and which cognitive domains are most long-term stress sensitive. Previous studies show inconsistent results and are difficult to synthesize. The primary aim of this study was to examine whether patients with work-related stress complaints have cognitive impairments compared to a matched control group without stress. Our secondary aim was to examine whether the level of self-reported perceived stress is associated with neuropsychological test performance. We used a broad neuropsychological test battery to assess 59 outpatients with work-related stress complaints (without major depression) and 59 healthy controls. We matched the patients and controls pairwise by sex, age and educational level. Compared to controls, patients generally showed mildly reduced performance across all the measured domains of the neuropsychological test battery. However, only three comparisons reached statistical significance (p50.05). Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were generally small to medium. The most pronounced differences between patients and controls were seen on tests of prospective memory, speed and complex working memory. There were no statistical significant associations between self-reported perceived stress level and neuropsychological test performance. In conclusion, we recommend that cognitive functions should be considered when evaluating patients with work-related stress complaints, especially when given advice regarding return to work. Since this study had a cross-sectional design, it is still uncertain whether the impairments are permanent. Further study is required to establish causal links between work-related stress and cognitive deficits.},

She hypothesized that personal dispositions would contribute more to understanding stress reactions during a prolonged stress state than during an acute state. The participants were Israeli Jewish adolescents living in West Bank settlements during the prolonged (chronic-without-acute-stress) state of the intifada (the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation) and during the chronic-with-acute-stress state, immediately after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. The author examined 5 variables as moderating factors--trait anxiety, sense of coherence, cognitive appraisal of the political situation, family sense of coherence, and sense of community--and measured 2 stress reactions--state anxiety and psychological distress. Data were collected from 266 8th-grade students during the chronic-without-acute-stress state and 448 students at the same grade level at the chronic-with-acute-stress state. The overall magnitude of variance explanation was different at each state: The author found a relatively high explained variance of state anxiety and psychological distress in the chronic-without-acute-stress situation but not in the chronic-with-acute stress state. These data support the value of developing a model that would recognize the different types of stress situations for moderating the effects of stress.},

Stress systems communicate threats to the entire organism, and as such, also stimulate inﬂammatory mechanisms. This modulation might serve protective functions in the short term, but sustained low-grade inﬂammation has severe long-term health consequences. While we have reached a reasonable level of understanding of acute, as well as chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammatory mechanisms, there is a signiﬁcant gap in our understanding of the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. The purpose of this review is to ﬁrst summarize current knowledge of our understanding of acute stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, as well as of chronic stress eﬀects on inﬂammation, and to then analyze the state of knowledge about the transitional phase between acute and chronic stress. Research discussed here shows that we are beginning to understand the early phase of repeated acute stress, but lack information on longer term exposure to repeated acute stress experiences. More research is needed to bridge this important gap und our conceptualization and understanding of the stress and health relationship.},

	abstract = {Objective: Life stress is hypothesized to alter the dynamic regulation of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune systems. This study examined the effects of antecedent chronic life stress on psychological and physiological responsivity after acute challenge with a psychological stressor. Method: Using a within-subject mixed design, male volunteers with [N = 12) and without chronic life stress (N = 11) were administered a 12-minute laboratory stressor (mental arithmetic) vs a video control. Results: Acute psychological stress induced subjective distress, increases of circulating concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, /3-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}), and cortisol, and a selective redistribution of natural killer ({NK}) cells into the peripheral blood as compared with the video control condition. Although the two groups were almost identical at baseline in psychological, sympathetic, neuroendocrine, and immune domains, the chronic stress group showed greater subjective distress, higher peak levels of epinephrine, lower peak levels of /3-endorphin and of {NK} cell lysis, and a more pronounced redistribution of {NK} cells in response to the acute psychological challenge than the controls. Furthermore, the acute stressor induced a protracted decline in {NK} lysis per {NK} cell in the chronic stress group but had no effect in the controls. Conclusions: In summary, when persons who are undergoing chronic life stress are confronted with an acute psychological challenge, an exaggerated psychologic and peak sympathomedullary reactivity occurs that is associated with decrements in individual {NK} cell function and is protracted beyond termination of the stressor and sympathomedullary recovery.},

We examined in mice and humans whether chronic stress has similar consequences. Male C57BL/6J mice that had been repeatedly exposed to rats (‘‘rat stress”) used in a circular hole board task signiﬁcantly more often a stimulus-response strategy (33\%) than control mice (0\%). While velocity was increased, differences in latency to exit hole, distance moved or number of holes visited were not observed. Increased velocity and performance during retention trials one day later indicates altered emotionality and motivation to explore in rat stressed mice. Forty healthy young men and women were split into ‘‘high chronic stress” and ‘‘low chronic stress” groups based on their answers in a chronic stress questionnaire (‘‘Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress”—{TICS}) and trained in a 2D task. A test trial immediately after training revealed that participants of the ‘‘high chronic stress” group used the S-R strategy signiﬁcantly more often (94\%) than participants of the ‘‘low chronic stress” group (52\%). Verbal self-reports conﬁrmed the strategy derived from participants’ choice in the test trial. Learning performance was unaffected by the chronic stress level. We conclude that one consequence of chronic stress is the shift to more rigid stimulus-response learning, that is accompanied by changes in motivational factors in mice.},

	abstract = {In this review, we report on studies that have assessed the eﬀects of exogenous and endogenous increases in stress hormones on human cognitive performance. We ﬁrst describe the history of the studies on the eﬀects of using exogenous stress hormones such as glucocorticoids as anti-inﬂammatory medications on human cognition and mental health. Here, we summarize the cases that led to the diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced ‘steroid psychosis’ in human populations and which demonstrated that these stress hormones could thus cross the blood–brain barrier and access the brain where they could inﬂuence cognition and mental health. We then summarize studies that assessed the eﬀects of the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance supported by the hippocampus, the frontal lobes and amygdala. In the second section of the paper, we summarize the eﬀects of the endogenous release of glucocorticoids induced by exposure to a stressful situation on human cognition and we further dissociate the eﬀects of emotion from those of stress on human learning and memory. Finally, in the last section of the paper, we discuss the potential impact that the environmental context to which we expose participants when assessing their memory could have on their reactivity to stress and subsequent cognitive performance. In order to make our point, we discuss the ﬁeld of memory and aging and we suggest that some of the ‘age-related memory impairments’ observed in the literature could be partly due to increased stress reactivity in older adults to the environmental context of testing. We also discuss the inverse negative correlations reported between hippocampal volume and memory for young and older adults and suggest that these inverse correlations could be partly due to the eﬀects of contextual stress in young and older adults, as a function of age-related diﬀerences in hippocampal volume.},

The research linking chronic stress and {HPA} function is contradictory, however, with some studies reporting increased activation, and others reporting the opposite. This meta-analysis showed that much of the variability is attributable to stressor and person features. Timing is an especially critical element, as hormonal activity is elevated at stressor onset but reduces as time passes. Stressors that threaten physical integrity, involve trauma, and are uncontrollable elicit a high, flat diurnal profile of cortisol secretion. Finally, {HPA} activity is shaped by a person’s response to the situation; it increases with subjective distress but is lower in persons with posttraumatic stress disorder.},

	abstract = {Objectives We assessed the effects of acute and chronic stress on prospective memory to examine whether stress differentially impacts prospective memory in cannabis users vs. non-users.
Methods Forty cannabis users and 42 non-users were assigned an episodic and a habitual prospective memory test before completing either the stress or no stress condition of the Maastricht Acute Stress Test ({MAST}). Participants were instructed to execute the habitual test during the {MAST} and the episodic test shortly after the {MAST}. Chronic stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, and acute stress was measured using subjective ratings and cortisol.
Results There was a main effect of acute stress indicating that stress detrimentally impacted habitual prospective memory performance. Although there was not a significant stress x cannabis interaction, further planned comparisons indicated the habitual prospective memory impairment was selective to cannabis users. There were also significant negative correlations between (i) episodic prospective memory and both subjective stress as well as chronic stress, and (ii) habitual prospective memory and change in subjective stress.
Conclusions This study is the first to reveal detrimental effects of acute stress on prospective memory performance, which may be exacerbated in cannabis users.},

	abstract = {Stress is known to exert considerable impact on learning and memory processes. Typically, human studies have investigated memory for single items (e.g., pictures, words), but it remains unresolved how exactly stress may alter the storage of memories into their original encoding context (i.e., memory contextualization). Since neurocircuitry underlying memory contextualization processes is sensitive to the well-known stress hormone cortisol, we here investigated whether cortisol mediates stress effects on memory contextualization. Forty healthy young men were randomly assigned to a psychosocial stress or control group. Ten minutes after stress manipulation offset, participants were instructed to learn and remember neutral and negative words, each of which was depicted against a unique background picture. Approximately 24 h later, memory was tested by means of cued retrieval and recognition tasks. To assess memory contextualization half of the words were tested in intact item—contexts pairs, and half in rearranged item—context combinations. Recognition data showed that cortisol, but no other indices of stress such as heart rate or subjective stress, mediated the effects of stress on contextualization of neutral and negative memories. The mediation analysis further showed that stress resulted in increases in cortisol and that cortisol was positively related to memory contextualization, but unrelated to other measures of memory. Thus, there seems to be a speciﬁc role for cortisol in the integration of a central memory into its surrounding context.},

However, previous functional neuroimaging studies showing differences in remembering and episodic simulation have focused on veridical retrieval of past experiences, and thus have not fully considered how retrieving the past in different ways from how it was originally experienced may also place similar demands on constructive processes. Here we examined how alternative versions of the past are constructed when adopting different egocentric perspectives during autobiographical memory retrieval compared to simulating hypothetical events from the personal past that could have occurred, or episodic counterfactual thinking. Participants were asked to generate titles for specific autobiographical memories from the last five years, and then, during functional magnetic resonance ({fMRI}) scanning, were asked to repeatedly retrieve autobiographical memories or imagine counterfactual events cued by the titles. We used an {fMRI} adaptation paradigm in order to isolate neural regions that were sensitive to adopting alternative egocentric perspectives and counterfactual simulations of the personal past. The {fMRI} results revealed that voxels within left posterior inferior parietal and ventrolateral frontal cortices were sensitive to novel visual perspectives and counterfactual simulations. Our findings suggest that the neural regions supporting remembering become more similar to those underlying episodic simulation when we adopt alternative egocentric perspectives of the veridical past.},

While most studies focus on the effects of {GCs} on the performance within a single memory system, we asked whether {GCs} modulate also the transition between hippocampus-dependent spatial and caudate nucleus-dependent stimulus—response memory systems. Eighty-four young healthy women received a placebo, 5 or 30 mg hydrocortisone orally. One hour later, participants were asked to locate a win-card in a 3D model of a room. The card could be located via two strategies: spatial (multiple distal cues) and stimulus—response (a single proximal cue). Relocation of the proximal cue after 12 trials revealed the strategy, number of trials to learning criterion the performance. As expected, more trials were needed to acquire the task with hydrocortisone. Remarkably, hydrocortisone switched the use of learning strategies towards more spatial learning (dose-dependently: placebo 4\% {\textless} 5 mg 21\% {\textless} 30 mg 32\%), independent of autonomic and subjective arousal. The learning curves of spatial and stimulus—response learners were comparable. Our results demonstrate that exogenous {GCs} prior to learning affect the performance within a memory system and also coordinate the use of multiple memory systems. Taking into account this dual action of {GCs} will contribute to a better understanding of stress (hormone) effects on learning and memory.},

However, the same flexible retrieval and recombination processes that underpin these adaptive functions may also leave memory prone to error or distortion, such as source misattributions in which details of one event are mistakenly attributed to another related event. To determine whether the same recombination-related retrieval mechanism supports both successful inference and source memory errors, we developed a modified version of an associative inference paradigm in which participants encoded everyday scenes comprised of people, objects, and other contextual details. These scenes contained overlapping elements ({AB}, {BC}) that could later be linked to support novel inferential retrieval regarding elements that had not appeared together previously ({AC}). Our critical experimental manipulation concerned whether contextual details were probed before or after the associative inference test, thereby allowing us to assess whether a) false memories increased for successful versus unsuccessful inferences, and b) any such effects were specific to after as compared to before participants received the inference test. In each of four experiments that used variants of this paradigm, participants were more susceptible to false memories for contextual details after successful than unsuccessful inferential retrieval, but only when contextual details were probed after the associative inference test. These results suggest that the retrieval-mediated recombination mechanism that underlies associative inference also contributes to source misattributions that result from combining elements of distinct episodes.},

Such flexibility is thought to be supported in part by memory integration, a process whereby related memories become interconnected in the brain through recruitment of overlapping neuronal populations. Recent advances in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience highlight the importance of a hippocampal–medial prefrontal circuit in memory integration. Emerging evidence suggests that abstracted representations in medial prefrontal cortex guide reactivation of related memories during new encoding events, thus promoting hippocampal integration of related experiences. Moreover, recent work indicates that integrated memories are called upon during novel situations to facilitate a host of behaviors, from spatial navigation to imagination.},

A brief battery of episodic memory tasks was administered which included tests of Logical Memory, Verbal Paired Associates, Digit Symbol Substitution, and Digit Symbol Incidental Learning. Results suggest that everyday hassles and irritations as well as the accumulation of challenging life events may exacerbate age-related decline on episodic memory tests that require greater executive resources and more integrated and elaborative processing. The functional relationship between affective status and risk for dementia is discussed, and consideration of individual differences in everyday stress is suggested so as to allow more sensitive interpretation of episodic memory tests commonly used to discern mild cognitive impairment.},

According to this framework, emotionally arousing objects attract attention that enhances binding of their constituent features. In contrast, the emotional arousal associated with one object either impairs or has no effect on the associations between that object and other distinct objects or background contextual information. After initial encoding, the attentiongrabbing nature of emotionally arousing objects can lead to interference in working memory, making it more difﬁcult to maintain other bound representations. These contrasting effects of arousal on memory binding should help predict which aspects of emotional memories are likely to be accurate and which aspects are likely to be misremembered.},

	abstract = {Acute stress can have both detrimental and beneficial effects on cognitive processing, but effects on concentration performance remain unclear. Here, we investigate the effects of acute psychosocial stress on concentration performance and possible underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms. The study sample comprised 47 healthy male participants who were randomly assigned either to a psychosocial stress situation (Trier Social Stress Test) or a neutral control task. Concentration performance was assessed using the d2 Test of Attention before and 30 min after the stress or control task. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase were repeatedly measured before and up to 1 hr after stress. We repeatedly assessed state anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and anticipatory cognitive stress appraisal using the Primary Appraisal Secondary Appraisal questionnaire. The stress group showed a significantly stronger improvement of concentration performance compared to the control group (p = .042). Concentration performance improvement was predicted by increased state anxiety (p = .020) and lower cortisol (stress) changes (p = .043). Neither changes in alpha-amylase nor cognitive stress appraisal did relate to concentration performance. Our results show improved concentration performance after acute psychosocial stress induction that was predicted by higher state anxiety increases and lower cortisol increases. This points to a potential modulating role of specific psycho-emotional and physiological factors with opposite effects.},

	abstract = {In this article, we examine the hypothesis that cognitive deﬁcits in subclinical depression become especially evident in tasks that require the integration of piecemeal information into more coherent mental representations, such as mental models. It is argued that in states of subclinical depression, attempts at integrative thinking or problem solving are limited by cognitive exhaustion which prevents the use of effective cognitive strategies. This basic argument is illustrated by paradigms addressing the construction of mental models based on sentiment or linear order information. It is shown that subclinical depression is associated with a distinct deﬁcit in integrative reasoning, but no deﬁcits in non-integrative processing such as initial information sampling or memory retrieval. Recent evidence of a neurophysiological correlate of this speciﬁc deﬁcit in subclinical depression is discussed in terms of the moderating role of frontal alpha asymmetry, and in terms of a speciﬁc pattern of parietal brain activation during processing of mental models. Also, a distinctive, not deﬁcit-related, facet of depressed cognitive symptoms is proposed, indicating a possible adaptive value of defocused attention in subclinically depressed mood. This defocused attention approach is supported by experimental and eyetracking research, and by recent theoretical models and empirical evidence showing performance beneﬁts in depression for some cognitive and creative tasks.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research has indicated that acute stress can critically impact memory. However, there are a number of inconsistencies in the literature, and important questions remain regarding the conditions under which stress effects emerge as well as basic questions about how stress impacts different phases of memory. In this meta-analysis, we examined 113 independent studies in humans with 6,216 participants that explored effects of stress on encoding, post-encoding, retrieval, or post-reactivation phases of episodic memory. The results indicated that when stress occurred prior to or during encoding it impaired memory, unless both the delay between the stressor and encoding was very short and the study materials were directly related to the stressor, in which case stress improved encoding. In contrast, post-encoding stress improved memory unless the stressor occurred in a different physical context than the study materials. When stress occurred just prior to or during retrieval, memory was impaired, and these effects were larger for emotionally valenced materials than neutral materials. Although stress consistently increased cortisol, the magnitude of the cortisol response was not related to the effects of stress on memory. Nonetheless, the effects of stress on memory were generally reduced in magnitude for women taking hormonal contraceptives. These analyses indicate that stress disrupts some episodic memory processes while enhancing others, and that the effects of stress are modulated by a number of critical factors. These results provide important constraints on current theories of stress and memory, and point to new questions for future research.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal shrinkage is a commonly found neuroanatomical change in stress-related mood disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorders ({PTSD}). Since the onset and severity of these disorders have been found to be closely related to stressful life events, and as stress alone has been shown to reduce hippocampal volume in animal studies, vulnerability to mood disorders may be related to a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal shrinkage. However, a smaller hippocampal volume before stress exposure has also been suggested to confer vulnerability of stressed individuals to {PTSD} or depression. In this study, we examined the contribution of either innate hippocampal volume differences or hippocampal susceptibility to stress-induced shrinkage to the formation of stress-related psychopathology using longitudinal {MRI} measurements of hippocampal volume in inbred C57 mice before and after chronic social defeat stress. We found that only half of the stressed C57 mice were susceptible to stress and developed psychopathological behaviors such as social avoidance. The other half was resilient to stress and exhibited no social avoidance. Before exposure to stress, we observed a positive correlation between hippocampal volume and social avoidance. After chronic social defeat stress, we found signiﬁcant increases in left hippocampal volume in resilient and nonstressed control mice. Intriguingly, this increase in hippocampal volume was not found in susceptible mice, suggesting an arrestment of hippocampal growth in these mice. Our ﬁndings suggest that both a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal volume changes and a larger hippocampus before stress exposure confer vulnerability to psychopathology after chronic stress. {VC} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Method: A virtual reality video was used to simulate an analogue trauma. Questionnaires, a free recall task, and an eye-tracking measure assessed cognitive changes after exposure.
Results: Regression analysis demonstrated that trait dissociation at pre-exposure to trauma significantly predicted {DDP}. Attention bias towards threat-related images was found. Results showed that {DDP} and poorer free recall predicted attention bias to threat images and higher levels of {DDP} actually predicted higher overall scores in the free recall task.
Conclusions: This study showed that {DDP} is strongly linked to dissociative traits, and along with memory disintegration it may predict attention changes after exposure to a trauma.},

Recent studies suggest that the underlying process of integrating related memories may depend on interaction between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Here, we investigated how hippocampal damage affects memory integration. Subjects with mediotemporal lesions and healthy controls learned a set of overlapping {AB}- and {BC}-associations (object-face- and face-object pairs) and were then tested for memory of these associations (“direct” trials) and of inferential {AC}-associations (“indirect” trials). The experiment consisted of four encoding/retrieval cycles. In direct trials, performance of patients and controls was similar and stable across cycles. By contrast, in indirect trials, patients and controls showed distinct patterns of behavior. Whereas patients and controls initially showed only minor differences, controls increased performance across subsequent cycles, while patient performance decreased to chance level. Further analysis suggested that this deficit was not merely a consequence of impaired associative memory but rather resulted from an additional hippocampal contribution to memory integration. Our findings further suggest that contextual factors modulate this contribution. Patient deficits in more complex memory-guided behavior may depend on the flexible interaction of hippocampus-dependent and -independent mechanisms of memory integration.},

	abstract = {Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that stress may orchestrate the engagement of multiple memory systems in the brain. In particular, stress is thought to favor dorsal striatum-dependent procedural over hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects of stress remain elusive, especially in humans. Here, we targeted the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor ({MR}) in the stress-induced modulation of dorsal striatal and hippocampal memory systems in the human brain using a combination of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacologic blockade of the {MR}.
Methods: Eighty healthy participants received the {MR} antagonist spironolactone (300 mg) or a placebo and underwent a stressor or control manipulation before they performed, in the scanner, a classiﬁcation task that can be supported by the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum.
Results: Stress after placebo did not affect learning performance but reduced explicit task knowledge and led to a relative increase in the use of more procedural learning strategies. At the neural level, stress promoted striatum-based learning at the expense of hippocampus-based learning. Functional connectivity analyses showed that this shift was associated with altered coupling of the amygdala with the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade before stress prevented the stress-induced shift toward dorsal striatal procedural learning, same as the stress-induced alterations of amygdala connectivity with hippocampus and dorsal striatum, but resulted in signiﬁcantly impaired performance.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings indicate that the stress-induced shift from hippocampal to dorsal striatal memory systems is mediated by the amygdala, required to preserve performance after stress, and dependent on the {MR}.},

	abstract = {Researchers interested in the neurobiology of the acute stress response in humans require a valid and reliable acute stressor that can be used under experimental conditions. The Trier Social Stress Test ({TSST}) provides such a testing platform. It induces stress by requiring participants to make an interview-style presentation, followed by a surprise mental arithmetic test, in front of an interview panel who do not provide feedback or encouragement. In this review, we outline the methodology of the {TSST}, and discuss key ﬁndings under conditions of health and stress-related disorder. The {TSST} has unveiled differences in males and females, as well as different age groups, in their neurobiological response to acute stress. The {TSST} has also deepened our understanding of how genotype may moderate the cognitive neurobiology of acute stress, and exciting new inroads have been made in understanding epigenetic contributions to the biological regulation of the acute stress response using the {TSST}. A number of innovative adaptations have been developed which allow for the {TSST} to be used in group settings, with children, in combination with brain imaging, and with virtual committees. Future applications may incorporate the emerging links between the gut microbiome and the stress response. Future research should also maximise use of behavioural data generated by the {TSST}. Alternative acute stress paradigms may have utility over the {TSST} in certain situations, such as those that require repeat testing. Nonetheless, we expect that the {TSST} remains the gold standard for examining the cognitive neurobiology of acute stress in humans.},

In Experiment 1, participants in a room with slightly dimmed lighting cheated more and thus earned more undeserved money than those in a well-lit room. In Experiment 2, participants wearing sunglasses behaved more selfishly than those wearing clear glasses. Finally, in Experiment 3, an illusory sense of anonymity mediated the relationship between darkness and self-interested behaviors. Across all three experiments, darkness had no bearing on actual anonymity, yet it still increased morally questionable behaviors. We suggest that the experience of darkness, even when subtle, may induce a sense of anonymity that is not proportionate to actual anonymity in a given situation.},

This article describes a pilot study involving a survey of 134 “bystanders” to determine their attitudes about helping and their support for laws mandating that bystanders help crime victims. Results show that the sample overwhelmingly indicated that they would help others themselves, but there was mixed support for laws requiring that individuals help those in need.

A review of the psychological literature reveals a complex relation between religious belief and moral action: leading to greater prosocial behavior in some contexts but not in others, and in some cases actually increasing antisocial behavior. In addition, different forms of religious belief are associated with different styles of co-operation. This body of evidence paints a somewhat messy picture of religious prosociality; however, recent examinations of the cognitive mechanisms of belief help to resolve apparent inconsistencies. In this article, we review evidence of two separate sources of religious prosociality: a religious principle associated with the protection of the religious group, and a supernatural principle associated with the belief in God, or other supernatural agents. These two principles emphasize different prosocial goals, and so have different effects on prosocial behavior depending on the target and context. A re-examination of the literature illustrates the independent inﬂuences of religious and supernatural principles on moral action.},

	abstract = {Numerous authors have suggested that religious belief has a positive association, possibly causal, with prosocial behavior. This article critiques evidence regarding this “religious prosociality” hypothesis from several areas of the literature. The extant literature on religious prosociality is reviewed including domains of charity, volunteering, morality, personality, and well-being. The experimental and quasiexperimental literature regarding controlled prosocial interactions (e.g., sharing and generosity) is reviewed and contrasted with results from naturalistic studies. Conceptual problems in the interpretation of this literature include separating the effects of stereotypes and ingroup biases from impression formation as well as controlling for self-report biases in the measurement of religious prosociality. Many effects attributed to religious processes can be explained in terms of general nonreligious psychological effects. Methodological problems that limit the interpretation of religious prosociality studies include the use of inappropriate comparison groups and the presence of criterion contamination in measures yielding misleading conclusions. Specifically, it is common practice to compare high levels of religiosity with “low religiosity” (e.g., the absence of denominational membership, lack of church attendance, or the low importance of religion), which conflates indifferent or uncommitted believers with the completely nonreligious. Finally, aspects of religious stereotype endorsement and ingroup bias can contribute to nonprosocial effects. These factors necessitate a revision of the religious prosociality hypothesis and suggest that future research should incorporate more stringent controls in order to reach less ambiguous conclusions.},

Non-normative, purely causal, psychological factors would be empirically relevant only if the notion of altruism is broadened to include the requirement that one recognize certain situations as calling for altruism.

	abstract = {Based on the unique features of morality, we suggest that group memberships rooted in moral convictions are a special classiﬁcation of inherently threatening social groups in which outgroup ‘‘hate’’ naturally occurs with ingroup ‘‘love.’’ Three studies explored emotional reactions to ingroups and outgroups by individuals whose group memberships were either morality-based or non-morality-based. Results of each study indicated that individuals in morality-based groups reported less positive ingroup emotions and more negative outgroup emotions and threat than did those in non-morality-based groups. Additionally, strength of morality-based identiﬁcation was predicted by attitudes about both the ingroup and the outgroup, but only attitudes about the ingroup predicted identiﬁcation for non-morality-based groups. Together, these studies suggest a necessary interdependence of ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity for social groups based in morality. We conclude that negative outgrouprelated emotions may be just as important as positive ingroup-related emotions for social identiﬁcation based on moral convictions.},

	abstract = {This study examined whether cultural values predict individuals’ moral attitudes. The main objective was to shed light on the moral universalism and relativism debate by showing that the answer depends on the moral issues studied. Using items from the Morally Debatable Behaviours Scale ({MDBS}) ﬁelded in the World Value Survey ({WVS}), we found that moral issues can be differentiated cross-culturally into attitudes towards (1) dishonest–illegal and (2) personal–sexual issues. Drawing upon evolutionary and cultural theories, we expected that the former moral domain is not related to cultural values, whereas the latter is inﬂuenced by cultural conceptions of the self (i.e. independent versus interdependent selves). We used multilevel modelling with Schwartz’ cultural values as the independent variables and the two moral domains as assessed through the {MDBS} as dependent variables to test our hypothesis. After controlling for individual-level differences in moral attitudes as well as the socio-economic development of countries, our ﬁndings conﬁrmed that attitudes towards dishonest–illegal issues were not related to cultural values whereas attitudes towards personal–sexual issues were predicted by the Autonomy–Embeddedness value dimension. We conclude that our study sheds not only light on the universalism and relativism debate, but also on the discriminant validity of cultural values. Copyright \# 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants expressed facing distinct forms of marginalization in secular and religious settings, leading to a state of “in-betweenness” characterized by a psychological distance from both communities. Participants' attitudes regarding social change, and how they voiced their critiques about women's issues, were also informed by the tensions between the two contexts.

Religious identification offers a distinctive “sacred” worldview and “eternal” group membership, unmatched by identification with other social groups.Thus, religiosity might be explained, at least partially, by the marked cognitive and emotional value that religious group membership provides. The uniqueness of a positive social group, grounded in a belief system that offers epistemological and ontological certainty, lends religious identity a twofold advantage for the promotion of well-being. However, that uniqueness may have equally negative impacts when religious identity itself is threatened through intergroup conflict. Such consequences are illustrated by an examination of identities ranging from religious fundamentalism to atheism. Consideration of religion’s dual function as a social identity and a belief system may facilitate greater understanding of the variability in its importance across individuals and groups.},

They discuss the ways that religion is intertwined with five moral foundations, in particular the group-focused “binding” foundations of Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, Purity/sanctity. The authors use this theoretical perspective to address three mysteries about religiosity, including why religious people are happier, why they are more charitable, and why most people in the world are religious.},

Findings indicate that in spite of the risks of being out and visible on campus, students were engaged in numerous forms of activism. Students who were not engaged saw engagement as too risky or did not know about the existence of other queer students. Professionals working with {LGBTQ} young adults in an Evangelical Christian environment should support them in resisting marginalization and finding community with other {LGBTQ} young adults and connect them to opportunities to enact social change.},

The relationship between feminism and religion is multifaceted. Religion is important in feminist political activism, throughout ﬁrst, second and third waves. Feminist activism is mutually inﬂuential to feminist theory, which approaches questions about gender not as optional, but as imperative to any rigorous analytic perspective. Feminist criticism of religion includes both feminist theology, which focuses on reforming religious traditions to be more egalitarian, and feminist scholarship in the academic study of religion, which challenges scholars to re-evaluate dominant models, such as the category of religion itself.},

It presents a novel case study of Israeli Modern-Orthodox Agunah activists who engage in highly politicized collective feminist resistance as religious actors working for religious ends. Embedded in and activated by Orthodoxy, they advocate women’s rights to divorce, voicing a moral critique of tradition and its agents precisely because they are devoutly devoted to them. Such political agency is innovatively conceptualized as “devoted resistance”: critique within relationship, enabled by cultural schema, and comprising both interpretive skills and “relational-autonomy” capacities. This study contends that understanding agency within religious grammars reveals its underlying logics, highlighting how structures shape the meanings and realization of women’s varied “agentive capacities.” It challenges current dichotomies like feminism/religion, resistance/submission, and autonomy/dependence. Overall, the author argues for a nuanced, culturally specific, capacity-based, relational approach to analyzing religious women’s agency.},

Using the approach of the study of social movements highlights the features that enable such a movement to operate and proliferate in the heterogeneous, ﬂuid, and distinctly noninstitutional context of the contemporary religious or spiritual ﬁeld and also to effect changes in the ranks of a traditional religious institution. Religious {LGBT} activism is a process-oriented and network-shaped movement that attributes positive value to and takes advantage of—and gains resilience from—an internal diversity in contrast to being institutionally organised and programmatically or dogmatically deﬁned. We suggest that the current public exposure and treatment of the issues around religion and sexuality should be seen as negations of old and legitimation of new religious identities—not only of sexual identities. Rather than mobilisation through collective identity, religious {LGBT} activism emerges as part of an active process of value production wherein reﬂexivity and diversity are central features fostered by both individual and collective negotiations of subjective and emotionally challenging and motivating experiences.},

We used a structural equation model to analyze the effects of perceived social support, self-concept and resilience on subjective well-being and school engagement. Results: The results provide evidence for the inﬂuence of the support of family, peer support and teacher support on selfconcept. In addition, self-concept is shown as a mediating variable associated with resilience, subjective well-being and school engagement. Conclusions: We discuss the results in the context of positive psychology and their practical implications in the school context.},

Relations among math self-concept ({MSC}), school grades, test scores, and school-level contextual effects over 6 years, from the end of primary school through the first 5 years of secondary school (a representative sample of 3,370 German students, 42 secondary schools, 50\% male, M age at grade 5 = 11.75) support the (1) internal/external frame of reference model: Math school grades had positive effects on {MSC}, but the effects of German grades were negative; (2) reciprocal effects (longitudinal panel) model: {MSC} was predictive of and predicted by math test scores and school grades; (3) big-fish-little-pond effect: The effects on {MSC} were negative for school-average achievement based on 4 indicators (primary school grades in math and German, school-track prior to the start of secondary school, math test scores in the first year of secondary school). Results for all 3 theoretical models were consistent across the 5 secondary school years: This supports the prediction of developmental equilibrium. This integration highlights the robustness of support over the potentially volatile early to middle adolescent period; the interconnectedness and complementarity of 3 {ASC} models; their counterbalancing strengths and weaknesses; and new theoretical, developmental, and substantive implications at their intersections.},

	abstract = {While early studies of moral decision making highlighted the role of rational, conscious executive processes involving frontal lobe activation more recent work has suggested that emotions and gut reactions have a key part to play in moral reasoning. Given that stress can activate many of the same brain regions that are important for and connected to brain centres involved in emotional processing we sought to evaluate if stress could inﬂuence moral decision making. Sixty-ﬁve undergraduate volunteers were randomly assigned to control (n = 33) and experimental groups (n = 32). The latter underwent the Trier Social Stress Test ({TSST}) and induction of stress was assessed by measurement of salivary cortisol levels. Subjects were then required to provide a response to thirty moral dilemmas via a computer interface that recorded both their decision and reaction time. Three types of dilemmas were used: non-moral, impersonal moral and personal moral. Using a binary logistic model there were no signiﬁcant predicators of utilitarian response in non-moral and impersonal moral dilemmas. However the stressed group and females were found to predict utilitarian responses to personal moral dilemmas. When comparing percentage utilitarian responses there were no signiﬁcant differences noted for the non-moral and impersonal moral dilemmas but the stressed group showed signiﬁcantly less utilitarian responses compared to control subjects. The stress response was signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with utilitarian responses. Females also showed signiﬁcantly less utilitarian responses than males. We conclude that activation of the stress response predisposed participants to less utilitarian responses when faced with high conﬂict personal moral dilemmas and suggest that this offers further support for dual process theory of moral judgment. We also conclude that females tend to make less utilitarian personal moral decisions compared to males, providing further evidence that there are gender differences in moral reasoning.},

In the experiments reported here, we showed that these effects also arise in simple perceptual-decision-making tasks. This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature—similarity, attraction, and compromise effects—all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making.},

	abstract = {Background: Based on social comparison theory, two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of depression and social comparison on adolescents, using the ultimatum game ({UG}).
Methods: Before the formal experiment began, a preliminary experiment tested the effectiveness of social comparison settings. This study used the {UG} paradigm to explore adolescents’ social decision-making in the context of gain and loss through two experiments. These experiments were designed as a 2 (group: depressive mood group, normal mood group) × 2 (social comparison: upward, downward) × 3 (fairness level: fair 5:5, unfair 3:7, extremely unfair 1:9) three-factor hybrid study.
Results: (1) The fairer the proposal was, the higher the sense of fairness participants felt, and the higher their acceptance rate. (2) The acceptance rate of the participants for downward social comparison was significantly higher than that for upward social comparison, but there was no difference in fairness perception between the two social comparisons. (3) Under the context of gain, the acceptance rate of the depressive mood group was higher than that of the normal mood group, but there was no difference in the acceptance rate between the depressive mood group and the normal mood group under the loss context. Depressive mood participants had more feelings of unfairness in the contexts of both gain and loss. (4) The effects of depressive mood, social comparison and the fairness level of distribution on social decisionmaking interact.
Conclusions: The interaction of social comparison, depressive mood and proposal type demonstrates that besides one’s emotion, cognitive biases and social factors can also have an effect on social decision-making. These findings indicate that behavioral decision boosting may provide an avenue for appropriate interventions in helping to guide adolescents to make social decisions.},

In 2 studies, participants in an emotionally charged debate expected either to remain on the same team or to join the opposing team when they returned the following week. Those who expected to join the opposing team were less willing to sacrifice for their future selves, leaving more of an unpleasant task for their future selves to finish and treating their future selves as unkindly as they treated a stranger.

Critically, the expression of the face was either congruent or incongruent with the feedback delivered. Analyses of participants’ choices revealed that the congruency of the emotional context with the feedback affects performance on the {IGT}: The ability to choose advantageously increases when the emotional context is congruent with feedback (i.e., happy faces after rewards and fearful ones after punishments), whereas this ability is impaired with an incongruent emotional context (i.e., fearful faces after rewards and happy faces after punishments). These findings provide evidence that decision making under ambiguity is driven by emotion-related signals, as postulated by the {SMH}.},

Results. We support the idea of five fundamental preconditions for ethical reasoning: self-knowledge, excellent training, experience or supervision, humility, and intervision. We recommend that psychologists meet these conditions in their professional decision making in order to promote the best quality of professional practice.
Conclusion. We can say that ethical reasoning is a professional moral decision. As professionals, we are primarily intuitive in our decision making, which is why we make decisions almost automatically; but our decisions are based on our professional experience. Psychologists should reflect on and understand the processes involved in decision making in order to avoid conclusions based on their personal experiences.},

In that framework, rationality is expressed as a single correct decision shared by experimenters and subjects that satisfies internal coherence within a set of preferences and beliefs. Outside of psychology, social scientists are now debating the need to modify rational choice theory with behavioral assumptions. Within psychology, researchers are debating assumptions about errors for many different definitions of rationality. Alternative frameworks are being proposed. These frameworks view decisions as more reasonable and adaptive than previously thought. For example, “rule following.” Rule following, which occurs when a rule or norm is applied to a situation, often minimizes effort and provides satisfying solutions that are “good enough,” though not necessarily the best. When rules are ambiguous, people look for reasons to guide their decisions. They may also let their emotions take charge.

As the majority of research in this area is directed on the differences between Asian and Western cultures, this review mainly focuses on the juxtaposition between these two cultures. Specifically, the authors outline the differences in probability judgements and confidence, risk perception, risk taking behaviours, consumer behaviour, and business and economic judgments and decisions. This review reveals that while judgement and decision making differs markedly between Asian and Western cultures, significant differences also exist within these cultures. The paper also suggests directions for future research in the area of cross-cultural judgement and decision making in order to garner a greater understanding of this subject.},

The research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and sometimes beneﬁcial drivers of decision making. Across different domains, important regularities appear in the mechanisms through which emotions inﬂuence judgments and choices. We organize and analyze what has been learned from the past 35 years of work on emotion and decision making. In so doing, we propose the emotion-imbued choice model, which accounts for inputs from traditional rational choice theory and from newer emotion research, synthesizing scientiﬁc models.},

	abstract = {As reﬂected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efﬁcient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do “rational” decisions as deﬁned by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuristics do people use in which situations?”) and the prescriptive question (“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

Social identity complexity reflects the degree of overlap perceived to exist between groups of which a person is simultaneously a member When the overlap of multiple ingroups is perceived to be high, the individual maintains a relatively simplified identity structure whereby memberships in different groups converge to form a single ingroup identification. When a person acknowledges, and accepts, that memberships in multiple ingroups are not fully convergent or overlapping, the associated identity structure is both more inclusive and more complex. In this article, we define the concept of social identity complexity and discuss its possible antecedents and consequences. Results from initial studies support the prediction that social identity complexity is affected by stress and is related to personal value priorities and to tolerance of outgroup members.},

Across four samples ( N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to broad generalized prejudice, r = −.03, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) [−.07, −.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with broad generalized prejudice, r = −.23, 95\% {CI} [−.31, −.16]. When target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice, they implied that perceiver–target dissimilarity on personality traits explains prejudice. Importantly, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups, suggesting it is the personality trait orienting people toward (dis)liking of others.},

Based on work suggesting that prejudices like this may have a value-laden component, we argue that the strongest predictors of {RR} will be those associated with conservatism: conscientiousness and openness. Using three national surveys, we find that conscientiousness and openness are the strongest predictors of {RR} among White Americans—matching the predictors of ideology but not a stereotyping measure.

In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets ( N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence ( g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice.

In our study (N = 183), various causal models of the relationships among the Big Five, {SDO}, {RWA}, and Generalized Prejudice are proposed and tested. Generalized Prejudice scores were obtained from a factor analysis of the scores on various prejudice instruments (racism, sexism, prejudice toward homosexuals, and mentally disabled people), which yielded a one‐factor solution. The best‐fitting causal model, which was our suggested hypothetical model, showed that Big Five personality had no direct effect on Generalized Prejudice but an indirect effect transmitted through {RWA} and {SDO}, where {RWA} seems to capture personality aspects to a greater extent than {SDO}. Specifically, Generalized Prejudice was affected indirectly by Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness through {RWA}, and by Agreeableness through {SDO}, whereas Neuroticism had no effect at all.

In Study 1, a female student simulates a broken leg and walks with crutches. She tries to get a seat on the tram in three manipulation conditions, wearing: a religious habit as a Christian nun (in-group), a hijab as a Muslim (out-group), and a black shirt with the word “God” crossed out as an atheist. In Study 2, a male student simulates queue-jumping in a supermarket, wearing: a religious habit as a Christian priest, a Jewish skullcap as a Jew, and a white shirt as a secular men. The results conﬁrmed the stated hypothesis, that helping and submissive behaviors was directed only to the in-group religious members, but not toward religious outsiders.

The programme evaluated was an in-house anti-racist education programme aimed at reducing prejudice towards Aboriginal Australians. The target audience were employees of a large public service organization. Knowledge of, prejudice towards, and stereotyping of Aboriginal Australians were assessed before commencing the programme to establish a baseline. Changes in these variables were assessed immediately after completing the programme, and again 3 months after completing the programme. The programme had pronounced effects immediately after completion: there was a signi®cant increase in knowledge and signi®cant decrease in prejudice and negative stereotyping. However, 3 months later, there was no signi®cant difference to baseline levels of prejudice and stereotyping. Knowledge remained signi®cantly higher than at baseline 3 months after completing the programme. High prejudice participants alone experienced a signi®cant, long-term decrease in old-fashioned racism. It is concluded that further research must be done to develop more successful strategies of prejudice reduction and stereotype change that are also applicable to `real world' contexts.

The intervention is based on the premise that implicit bias is like a habit that can be broken through a combination of awareness of implicit bias, concern about the effects of that bias, and the application of strategies to reduce bias. In a 12-week longitudinal study, people who received the intervention showed dramatic reductions in implicit race bias. People who were concerned about discrimination or who reported using the strategies showed the greatest reductions. The intervention also led to increases in concern about discrimination and personal awareness of bias over the duration of the study. People in the control group showed none of the above effects. Our results raise the hope of reducing persistent and unintentional forms of discrimination that arise from implicit bias.},

Reliability is demonstrated across three indices of ethnic attitudes in seven representative samples drawn fromfour European countries (West Germany, Netherlands, France, Great Britain; total N=3788). The hypothesis that this correlation reflects only the tendency of more highly educated respondents to give more socially desirable answers and not true attitude diferences was inconsistent with the3nding from the survey data that educational level also correlated negatively with responses to an index of subtle prejudice. Results from an experiment employing the bogus pipeline procedure similarly refute this hypothesis, indicating that {signiJicant} education-related diferences in expressed prejudice remain under conditions in which the tendency to give socially desirable responses is reduced. Finally, path analysis based on the survey data show that part but not all of the association between low education and ethnic prejudice is mediated b y social psychological variables, particularly group relative deprivation, perceived belief incongruency, political conservatism, and acceptance of inter-ethnic contact.},

We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models.},

However, it is not clear whether education reduces other prejudices against groups along different dimensions, including ideological identification. An analysis of American National Election Studies data from 1964 to 2012 shows that education is related to decreases in interethnic/interracial prejudice, but also to increases in ideological (liberal vs. conservative) prejudice. This finding could not be explained simply by the greater polarization of the American electorate in the past twenty years. The results require rethinking how and why education is associated with reduced prejudice for certain groups but not others.},

Based on work suggesting that prejudices like this may have a value-laden component, we argue that the strongest predictors of {RR} will be those associated with conservatism: conscientiousness and openness. Using three national surveys, we find that conscientiousness and openness are the strongest predictors of {RR} among White Americans—matching the predictors of ideology but not a stereotyping measure.

Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to broad generalized prejudice, r = −.03, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) [−.07, −.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with broad generalized prejudice, r = −.23, 95\% {CI} [−.31, −.16]. When target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice, they implied that perceiver–target dissimilarity on personality traits explains prejudice.

            Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.},

	url = {https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/dissertations/1739/},
	abstract = {The ritual gesture of laying on of hands in Scripture has generated significant interest among theologians from rabbinic times until now. Still today, scholars assign various meanings to the ritual. In the second half of the 20th century, the fresh interest that put forward new meanings for this gesture came primarily through the introduction of the new sub-discipline of Ritualistics within Old Testament studies. This relatively new discipline is not founded upon premises found in biblical texts, but rather, upon those found in various secular social, philosophical sciences, and other disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the study of religion. These disciplines often reject major presuppositions found in biblical texts, and scholarly studies based on these approaches have produced multiple proposals regarding the meaning of this gesture. Such proposals generally offer incomplete, limited insights into the biblical meaning conveyed by laying on of hands. I have sought to avoid this interpretative misstep in the context of identifying the meaning of laying on of hands by (1) adopting premises found in the biblical text, especially concerning the nature of human beings and the concepts of sin and atonement, and (2) conducting a reading of the biblical text that applies a terminological/contextual/intertextual approach.  This study is divided into three sections. In the first section, I explore the concept of sin in the Pentateuch (ch. two) and establish terminology to express the nature of sin (ch. three). I utilize simple legal terminology based upon my reading of Lev 4-6. In the second section, I conduct an in-depth study of the Hebrew כִּפֶּר to establish the concept of atonement (ch. four) and critically evaluate the commonly-accepted automatic defilement hypothesis (ch. five). In the third section, I present the ritual theory created by biblical scholars that coincides with the theoretical framework that I identified in the course of this study, which assisted in achieving the main and initial goal of this study, namely, to identify the meaning of laying on of hands in cultic contexts in the Pentateuch. The resulting data of this study enables me to expose limitations and errors included in various scholarly proposals concerning the meaning of the laying on of hands.'  The traditional meaning of laying on of hands in cultic contexts has been that of transfer, with various qualities transferred such as sin, guilt, authority, general human sinfulness, and others. Very often the idea of substitution is included in the meaning of the ritual. Through a fresh study of the concepts of sin and atonement, and building upon biblical premises concerning the nature of human beings, I conclude that the meaning of transfer emerges from the biblical texts more than any other, and constitutes the foundational meaning of this ritual.},

Therefore the use of kinesics and other methods of analyzing nonverbal communication become a valuable interpretative tool for biblical scholars.

The {FAE} occurs in part because dispositional explanations are relatively automatic, whereas considering the situation requires additional cognitive effort. Stress is known to impair the prefrontal cortex and executive functions important for the attribution process. We investigated if stress increases dispositional attributions in common place and legal situations. Experiencing a physiological stressor increased participants’ cortisol, dispositional attributions of common everyday behaviors, and negative evaluations. When determining whether a crime was due to the defendant’s disposition or the mitigating situation, self-reported stress correlated with increased dispositional judgments of defendant’s behavior. These findings indicate that stress may makes people more likely to commit the {FAE} and less favorable in their evaluations of others both in daily life and when making socially consequential judicial decisions.},

The Reich's political ideology, when mixed with theology of the German Christian movement, turned Jesus into a divine representation of the ideal, racially pure Aryan and allowed race-hate to become part of Germany's religious life. Bonhoeffer provided a Christian response to Nazi atrocities. In this book author Reggie L. Williams follows Bonhoeffer as he defies Germany with Harlem's black Jesus. The Christology Bonhoeffer learned in Harlem's churches featured a black Christ who suffered with African Americans in their struggle against systemic injustice and racial violence-and then resisted. In the pews of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, under the leadership of Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., Bonhoeffer absorbed the Christianity of the Harlem Renaissance. This Christianity included a Jesus who stands with the oppressed rather than joins the oppressors and a theology that challenges the way God can be used to underwrite a union of race and religion. Bonhoeffer's Black Jesus argues that the black American narrative led Dietrich Bonhoeffer to the truth that obedience to Jesus requires concrete historical action. This ethic of resistance not only indicted the church of the German Volk, but also continues to shape the nature of Christian discipleship today},

	abstract = {Prospective memory ({PM}) refers to mnemonic processes, which are directed to the future. It has been subdivided into different stages of processing: the planning, retention, performance, and evaluation phase. Moreover, {PM} can be time- or event-based. It is well known that retrospective memory ({RM}) can be affected by stress as seen in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). However, data on the effects of stress on {PM} are rare. In this review, available behavioral studies of {PM} are reviewed with respect to its vulnerability to stress. Based on the available data, we suggest that stress may have enhancing or disturbing effects on {PM}, depending on (a) the stressor characteristics, (b) whether {PM} is time- or event-based, and (c) which phase of processing is affected. Studies in healthy adults indicate rather an increase of {PM} in response to acute stress (average effect size of d ϭ .10). In contrast, studies in {PTSD} patients found a deteriorating effect of the disorder on {PM} performance (average effect size of d ϭ Ϫ.58). We discuss the putative clinical relevance of a better knowledge of the relationship between stress and {PM} for the diagnosis and therapy of {PTSD}.},

	abstract = {Learning occurs in the context of existing memories. Encountering new information that relates to prior knowledge may trigger integration, whereby established memories are updated to incorporate new content. Here, we provide a critical test of recent theories suggesting hippocampal ({HPC}) and medial prefrontal ({MPFC}) involvement in integration, both during and immediately following encoding. Human participants with established memories for a set of initial ({AB}) associations underwent {fMRI} scanning during passive rest and encoding of new related ({BC}) and unrelated ({XY}) pairs. We show that {HPC}-{MPFC} functional coupling during learning was more predictive of trial-by-trial memory for associations related to prior knowledge relative to unrelated associations. Moreover, the degree to which {HPC}-{MPFC} functional coupling was enhanced following overlapping encoding was related to memory integration behavior across participants. We observed a dissociation between anterior and posterior {MPFC}, with integration signatures during post-encoding rest specifically in the posterior subregion. These results highlight the persistence of integration signatures into post-encoding periods, indicating continued processing of interrelated memories during rest. We also interrogated the coherence of white matter tracts to assess the hypothesis that integration behavior would be related to the integrity of the underlying anatomical pathways. Consistent with our predictions, more coherent {HPC}-{MPFC} white matter structure was associated with better performance across participants. This {HPC}-{MPFC} circuit also interacted with content-sensitive visual cortex during learning and rest, consistent with reinstatement of prior knowledge to enable updating. These results show that the {HPC}-{MPFC} circuit supports on- and offline integration of new content into memory.},

	abstract = {The reconsolidation hypothesis proposes that a previously consolidated memory recalled by a reminder enters an unstable state (memory labilization) during which it is transiently sensitive to disruption. Although this process has been shown in very diverse species and types of memories, including human declarative memory, elucidating the role of this process is still an open challenge. The hypothesis that reconsolidation allows the incorporation of new information has recently been demonstrated in humans. However, the ﬁndings show that, during the reconsolidation phase, memory retention can be increased by pharmacological modulation or real life events in animals have not been found in humans yet. In order to evaluate this, we used a paradigm of human declarative memory whose reminder structure allows us to differentiate between a retrieved labile memory state and a retrieved but non-labile state. Volunteers learned an association between ﬁve cue-syllables and their respective response-syllables. 6 days later, the paired-associate memory was reactivated by exposing the subjects to the reminder, and then they received a mild stressor, cold pressor stress ({CPS}). Poor memory performance was found at both the time of memory reactivation (day 6 after training) and at testing of all groups that were designed as controls (day 7). Conversely, robust memory performance was shown at testing when the {CPS} administration was concurrent with the retrieved-labile memory state. Results from the present study reveal that a naturalistic mild stressor can enhance reconsolidation, improving the long-term expression of this declarative memory. This ﬁnding might have signiﬁcant implications for the comprehension of memory persistence and memory expression, and add new evidence in order to understand the adaptive meaning of the reconsolidation process. © 2011 {IBRO}.

	abstract = {The processes of memory formation and storage are complex and highly dynamic. Once memories are consolidated, they are not necessarily ﬁxed but can be changed long after storage. In particular, seemingly stable memories may re-enter an unstable state when they are retrieved, from which they must be re-stabilized during a process known as reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, memories are susceptible to modiﬁcations again, thus providing an opportunity to update seemingly stable memories. While initial demonstrations of memory reconsolidation came mainly from animal studies, evidence for reconsolidation in humans is now accumulating as well. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of human memory reconsolidation. After a summary of ﬁndings on the reconsolidation of human fear and episodic memory, we focus particularly on recent neuroimaging data that provide ﬁrst insights into how reconsolidation processes are implemented in the human brain. Finally, we discuss the implications of memory modiﬁcations during reconsolidation for the treatment of mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction.},

During the time it takes for the memory to re-stabilize (reconsolidate), the memory can either be reduced by an amnesic agent or enhanced by memory enhancers. The change in memory expression is related to changes in the brain correlates of long-term memory. Many have suggested that such retrieval-induced plasticity is ideally placed to enable memories to be updated with new information. This hypothesis has been tested experimentally, with a translational perspective, by attempts to update maladaptive memories in order to reduce their problematic impact. Here, we review the progress on reconsolidation-update studies, highlighting their translational exploitation and addressing recent challenges to the reconsolidation field.},

	abstract = {Memories are consolidated and are inscribed as stable traces in the brain; however, once they are retrieved, they are rendered labile and can be modified in a process termed reconsolidation. Studies illustrate the power of behavioral stress and stress hormones to modulate memory processes while focusing on consolidation. However, sparse evidence indicates a critical role of stress in modulating reconsolidation. In this review, we discuss the effects of stress and stress-related neurotransmitter systems on reconsolidation of emotional and nonemotional types of memories. We show that although some general features underlie consolidation and reconsolidation, there is a possible dissimilarity between the two processes that may be dependent on factors such as the cognitive task employed, specific type of stressor, and the arousal state of the animal. The ability to disrupt or facilitate the reconsolidation of emotional and drug-related memories by stress exposure has important implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders linked to traumatic memories, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and of drug-of-abuse memories.},

	abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) is characterized by traumatic memories that can manifest as daytime recollections, traumatic nightmares, or flashbacks in which components of the event are relived. These symptoms reflect excessive retrieval of traumatic memories that often retain their vividness and power to evoke distress for decades or even a lifetime. We have reported previously that elevated glucocorticoid levels inhibit memory retrieval in animals and healthy human subjects. We therefore hypothesized that the administration of cortisol might also inhibit the retrieval of traumatic memories in patients with {PTSD}. In a recent pilot study, we found the first evidence to support this hypothesis. During a 3-month observation period, low-dose cortisol (10 mg/day) was administered orally for 1 month to three patients with chronic {PTSD} using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. In each patient investigated, there was a significant treatment effect with cortisol-related reductions in one of the daily rated symptoms of traumatic memories without causing adverse side effects. Future studies with more patients and longer treatment periods are required to evaluate the efficacy of cortisol treatment for {PTSD}.},

Participants recalled positive, negative and neutral episodes from their recent past and were afterwards exposed to a stressor (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or a non-arousing control condition. Additional groups of participants were exposed to the stressor without prior memory reactivation or were neither stressed nor asked to recall episodes from their past. Stress after memory reactivation impaired the memory for the neutral episodes 1 week later whereas the subsequent memory for the emotional episodes was not affected by stress after reactivation. Reactivation per se or stress without prior memory reactivation had no effect on memory performance. These ﬁndings suggest that the effect of stress on memory reconsolidation is opposite to the stress effect on memory consolidation supporting the view that consolidation and reconsolidation are distinct processes.},

            Past research reveals the multiple ways that people grapple with the connections between religious and sexual identities. Some people perceive religious identities to be in conflict with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer ({LGBQ}) identities, but others believe such identities to be compatible. Some people look to religious authorities for guidance in understanding the connections between religious and {LGBQ} identities, whereas others rely on strategies of religious individualism. What factors affect people’s approaches to understanding the connections between religious and sexual identities? Drawing on 77 interviews with participants in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer ({LGBTQ}) activist groups at four Christian colleges and universities, and employing Goffmanian insights, this article shows how {LGBTQ} activist groups’ different audiences inspire distinct approaches to understanding religion and sexuality. The study demonstrates that activist groups can powerfully shape understandings of seemingly disparate social identities and suggests a theoretical framework for future research.},

Little is written on how {NIMBY} activism can redefine a place to be more inclusive of sexual minorities and supportive of progressive social initiatives. After the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in favor of marriage equality in Obergefell v. Hodges, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples citing her religious beliefs. Davis’ actions galvanized marriage-equality and religious-freedom activists in the region. Pro-marriage-equality activists included lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, and queer women who viewed Davis’ action as an attack on their legitimacy in the community. Drawing on 11 interviews with queer women in Kentucky, we explore how their activist work in Rowan County challenged small-town intolerance and religious homophobia and helped to re-form the region as more a progressive space for sexual minorities.},

We argue that for the 2006 spring immigrant rights marches understanding the inﬂuence of religion on participation requires a careful assessment of the relationship between various dimensions of religion and the risks, barriers, and motivations that are rooted in citizenship status of potential participants. Dimensions that enhance efﬁcacy are important for overcoming the participation obstacles that noncitizens faced. In contrast, dimensions that contributed to solidarity, opportunities, and framing fostered citizens’ mobilization. Our ﬁndings from the Pew Hispanic Center and the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life national survey of Latinos are consistent with the view that Charismatic identity and a salient personal religious faith were sources of empowerment that inspired noncitizen participation. Conversely, the emphasis on “law and order” of the biblical literalist as well as the pietistic orientation of a faith marked by personal prayer hindered marching among Latino noncitizens. Catholic and mainline Protestant traditions and a close association between faith and politics inﬂuenced citizen protest but not noncitizen involvement. Integration into congregations activated for immigrant rights and involvement in congregation-based volunteerism encouraged participation for both citizens and noncitizens.},

Our results suggest substantial utility in using a question frame referencing the distinct institutional expectations that clergy regularly confront. Speciﬁcally, when randomly primed to consider the expectations of institutional reference groups, clergy exhibit signiﬁcantly higher levels of conservatism and report higher levels of political engagement, which is in line with their church’s institutional preferences more generally. Our ﬁndings underscore the need for experimental methodology to make increased inroads into understanding political outcomes in religious contexts.},

The impact of various religious traditions is assessed by using measures for the density of religious population per congregation of three religious {traditionsdMainline} Protestantism, Evangelical Protestantism and Catholicism.

A discussion of {CSR}’s application to new religious movement ({NRM}) case studies (charismatic leadership, paradise representations, Aḥmadiyya, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness) identifies concerns about the theorized relationship between {CSR} and wider socio-cultural factors, and proposals for {CSR}’s implication in wider processes are discussed. The main discussion analyses three themes in recent work relating {CSR} to religious and religion-like activities that extend and reframe the model. These include (1) identification of distinctive and accessible cognitive pathways associated with new forms of religious belief and practice (in particular in ‘New Age’ movements), (2) application of {CSR} to movements and practices outside traditional definitions of religion (near death experiences, conspiracy theories, virtual reality), and (3) engaging {CSR} in wider cultural processes and negotiations (religion in healthcare settings, and the definition of the study of esoteric religious traditions within academic domains). The conclusion identifies two particular findings: (1) that application of {CSR} in these areas renders underlying cognitive processes more available to scrutiny and (2) that {CSR} is employed to identify and enlarge the category of religion. The conclusion suggests that the study of {CSR} in its application to {NRMs} and quasi-religion identifies a wide field of common and overlapping themes and interests in which {CSR} is a more active operand than is commonly assumed.},

	abstract = {In a time of increasing religious diversity, interfaith political coalitions have become important settings for interreligious interaction, but little research has explored the types of religious expression that are generated therein. Prevailing theories in the sociology of religion indicate that interaction with religious others results in dilution of traditional religious commitments or production of stronger boundaries. But emerging perspectives in cultural sociology shift attention from individual religious commitments to the ways in which settings shape different styles ofreligious expression. Insights about edge spaces drawnfrom urban theory suggest that religiously diverse settings can be generative of new types of religious practices. We apply these insights to the study of interfaith activism by drawing on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with religious advocacy professionals and activists working in interfaith coalitions. Conceptualizing the sites of these interfaith encounters as edge spaces, we analyze variation in the types of religious expression that occur in interfaith settings. We find that both aggregative and integrative practices are produced, but these vary depending on the goals and structure of the setting, as well as participants’ accountability to outside religious gatekeepers.},

However, little is known about how feminist identity develops worldwide, either in terms of social identity theory or the stage model of feminist identity development. Moreover, some women’s movement advocates view feminism with suspicion, as focused only on concerns of a narrow group of women. For this study, 45 women’s movement activists from China, India, Nicaragua, Poland, and the United States were interviewed as part of the Global Feminisms Project. Participants’ personal narratives were examined to identify themes activists used to describe their own feminist identity development. The six themes that emerged were education, social relationships, genderbased injustice, violence, activism, and emotion. Alternating least squares analysis of the concurrence of these themes revealed four pathways to feminist identity: (1) education, (2) social relationships and gender-based injustice, (3) violence, and (4) activism and emotion. These findings suggest that individuals come to feminist identity in different ways. Instructors aiming to encourage understanding of women’s movement activism should point to these different pathways, and feminist activists seeking to promote feminist identity development should consider different approaches to successfully engaging people.},

Experimentally induced religious thoughts reduce rates of cheating and increase altruistic behavior among anonymous strangers. Experiments demonstrate an association between apparent profession of religious devotion and greater trust. Cross-cultural evidence suggests an association between the cultural presence of morally concerned deities and large group size in humans.

Religious identification offers a distinctive “sacred” worldview and “eternal” group membership, unmatched by identification with other social groups.Thus, religiosity might be explained, at least partially, by the marked cognitive and emotional value that religious group membership provides. The uniqueness of a positive social group, grounded in a belief system that offers epistemological and ontological certainty, lends religious identity a twofold advantage for the promotion of well-being. However, that uniqueness may have equally negative impacts when religious identity itself is threatened through intergroup conflict. Such consequences are illustrated by an examination of identities ranging from religious fundamentalism to atheism. Consideration of religion’s dual function as a social identity and a belief system may facilitate greater understanding of the variability in its importance across individuals and groups.},

	abstract = {This study explores how religious women become legitimate actors in the public sphere and analyzes their agency—its meanings, capacities, and transformative aims. It presents a novel case study of Israeli Modern-Orthodox Agunah activists who engage in highly politicized collective feminist resistance as religious actors working for religious ends. Embedded in and activated by Orthodoxy, they advocate women’s rights to divorce, voicing a moral critique of tradition and its agents precisely because they are devoutly devoted to them. Such political agency is innovatively conceptualized as “devoted resistance”: critique within relationship, enabled by cultural schema, and comprising both interpretive skills and “relational-autonomy” capacities. This study contends that understanding agency within religious grammars reveals its underlying logics, highlighting how structures shape the meanings and realization of women’s varied “agentive capacities.” It challenges current dichotomies like feminism/religion, resistance/submission, and autonomy/dependence. Overall, the author argues for a nuanced, culturally specific, capacity-based, relational approach to analyzing religious women’s agency.},

The relationship between feminism and religion is multifaceted. Religion is important in feminist political activism, throughout ﬁrst, second and third waves. Feminist activism is mutually inﬂuential to feminist theory, which approaches questions about gender not as optional, but as imperative to any rigorous analytic perspective. Feminist criticism of religion includes both feminist theology, which focuses on reforming religious traditions to be more egalitarian, and feminist scholarship in the academic study of religion, which challenges scholars to re-evaluate dominant models, such as the category of religion itself.},

Using the approach of the study of social movements highlights the features that enable such a movement to operate and proliferate in the heterogeneous, ﬂuid, and distinctly noninstitutional context of the contemporary religious or spiritual ﬁeld and also to effect changes in the ranks of a traditional religious institution. Religious {LGBT} activism is a process-oriented and network-shaped movement that attributes positive value to and takes advantage of—and gains resilience from—an internal diversity in contrast to being institutionally organised and programmatically or dogmatically deﬁned. We suggest that the current public exposure and treatment of the issues around religion and sexuality should be seen as negations of old and legitimation of new religious identities—not only of sexual identities. Rather than mobilisation through collective identity, religious {LGBT} activism emerges as part of an active process of value production wherein reﬂexivity and diversity are central features fostered by both individual and collective negotiations of subjective and emotionally challenging and motivating experiences.},

Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants expressed facing distinct forms of marginalization in secular and religious settings, leading to a state of ‘‘in-betweenness’’ characterized by a psychological distance from both communities. Participants’ attitudes regarding social change, and how they voiced their critiques about women’s issues, were also informed by the tensions between the two contexts.

They discuss the ways that religion is intertwined with five moral foundations, in particular the group-focused “binding” foundations of Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, Purity/sanctity.

We framed ﬁrmness as mainly about loyalty to God and God’s purposes, and ﬂexibility as mainly about loyalty to family members and their needs and circumstances. The reported ﬁndings provided a range of examples illustrating (a) religious ﬁrmness, (b) religious ﬂexibility, as well as (c) efforts to balance and combine ﬁrmness and ﬂexibility.

And 78\% of the expanding group of those who identify as religiously unafﬁliated (“Nones”) reported that they were raised in “highly religious families.” We suggest that this may be, in part, associated with religious parents exercising excessive ﬁrmness with inadequate ﬂexibility (rigidity). We used a multiphase, systematic, team-based process to code 8000+ pages of in-depth interviews from 198 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim families from 17 states in all 8 major religio-cultural regions of the United States. We framed ﬁrmness as mainly about loyalty to God and God’s purposes, and ﬂexibility as mainly about loyalty to family members and their needs and circumstances. The reported ﬁndings provided a range of examples illustrating (a) religious ﬁrmness, (b) religious ﬂexibility, as well as (c) efforts to balance and combine ﬁrmness and ﬂexibility. We discuss conceptual and practical implications of treating ﬁrmness and ﬂexibility as complementary loyalties in intergenerational faith transmission.},

The authors hypothesize that men from conservative households will make earlier transitions to adulthood, work fewer hours, and earn less money. Moreover, the belief in strong paternal involvement should lead religiously conservative men to spend more time in housework and child care. Results show that conservative religious affiliation does not hasten the transition to adulthood among men. Current religious conservatism results in lower wages but not reduced work hours, and religious affiliation does not affect housework or child care.},

Dyadic growth-curve models revealed gender differences in aggravation trajectories over the first year of the child’s life. Fathers were higher in initial aggravation, but mothers’ aggravation grew at a faster rate over time. The primary hypothesis was only partially supported. Fathers’ contributions to childcare were associated with significantly lower maternal aggravation levels, but only among more religious mothers. Child fussiness and unpredictability were consistently significant predictors of higher aggravation for both parents. Depressive symptomatology was positively related to aggravation for fathers, whereas love for the spouse was associated with lower aggravation for mothers, controlling for other factors.},

The authors begin by reviewing popular writings on gender and family life by contemporary conservative Protestants, focusing on the competing discourses of traditionalist and egalitarian evangelicals. Then, the authors analyze data on a large U.S. sample of married couples from Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families and Households to compare conservative Protestant housework patterns with those among nonevangelical couples. Conservative Protestant wives perform more housework overall and spend more time doing “female-typed” labor than their nonevangelical peers. These differences are then traced to religious variations in spousal and household resources and also to a distinctive evangelical gender ideology. Interestingly, few religious differences in men's housework patterns are observed. Implications of these findings are discussed and several promising directions for future research identified.},

Using recent data from a national sample, the Survey of Marital Generosity ( N = 1,368 couples), we explored the associations between gender egalitarianism, familism, religiosity, and generous behavior among spouses aged 18 to 45. Our results suggest that domestic gender egalitarianism—where spouses reported sharing housework and child care—is linked to greater reports of marital generosity. Religiosity is also positively associated with marital generosity. Finally, the most potent predictor of generosity in this study is commitment, where spouses are personally dedicated to their partner and to continuing the relationship.},

	abstract = {Extant research suggests that supportive work–family policies promote gender equality in the workplace and in the household. Yet, evidence indicates that these policies generally have stronger effects on women’s preferences and behaviors than men’s. In this article, we draw on survey-experimental data to examine how young, unmarried men’s gender ideologies and perceptions of normative masculinity may moderate the effect of supportive work–family policy interventions on their preferences for structuring their future work and family life. Specifically, we examine whether men’s prescriptive beliefs about what work–family arrangements most people ought to prefer and whether men’s descriptive beliefs about what work–family arrangements most of their male peers actually do prefer influence their responses to supportive policies. Our analysis shows that men’s responses to supportive work–family policy interventions are highly dependent upon their beliefs about what their male peers actually want, rather than on their beliefs about what others should want. Specifically, men who believe that their male peers ideally want gender-egalitarian or counternormative relationships are themselves more likely to prefer a progressive relationship structure when supportive work–family policies are in place. These findings provide novel support for sociological theories of masculinity and hold important implications for designing policies that promote gender equality in the workplace and at home.

It was further found that a large number of hours devoted to housework or to paid work is positively related to the emotional wellbeing of participants with a traditional gender role ideology. Family-work conflict was found to be negatively related to emotional wellbeing among participants with an egalitarian gender role ideology. The findings present an egalitarian gender role ideology as a resource that contributes to explaining emotional wellbeing.

Using data for 1999 and 2003 from the Swedish longitudinal study, Young Adult Panel Survey, we examine the relationship between religiosity and several measures of attitudes and behaviors related to gender equality in the public and private spheres. We find for most religious denominations, greater religiosity is linked with more patriarchal views about the balance of men’s and women’s roles in the home. Among members of the Church of Sweden (formerly the Swedish State Church), however, this is not the case. No differences by religiosity were found in attitudes for gender equality in the public sphere of work. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Prior research has shown that these attitudes predict greater aggression toward female relationship partners, but has overlooked the contexts in which such aggression should occur. The present research identified an important contextual factor that determines when men’s hostile sexism is (and when it is not) associated with relationship aggression. Men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism were more aggressive toward their female partners during couples’ daily life (Study 1) and conflict discussions (Study 2), but only when their female partners were perceived to be, or reported being, low in relationship commitment. These findings show that men who endorse hostile sexism do not always enact aggression toward female partners, but do so in contexts relevant to their fears that women will exploit men’s relational dependence and undermine men’s power.},

This theory or framework has its roots in the work of Black feminist scholar-activists, and it focuses on interlocking systems of oppression and the need to work toward structural-level changes to promote social justice and equity. Thus, the current interest in intersectionality in psychology presents an opportunity to draw psychologists’ attention more to structural-level issues and to make social justice and equity more central agendas to the field. The large, ever-growing bodies of research demonstrating the wide-ranging adverse consequences of structural- and interpersonal-level oppression, inequality, and stigma for the health and well-being of many diverse groups of people support that these issues are central to the field of psychology. We as individual psychologists and the field as a whole can work to fully incorporate the insights of intersectionality and therefore contribute to making social justice and equity more central across the varied subfields and realms of our work. Specific ways that we can do this are to (a) engage and collaborate with communities, (b) address and critique societal structures, (c) work together/build coalitions, (d) attend to resistance in addition to resilience, and (e) teach social justice curricula. There are important examples both within and outside of psychology that can guide us in achieving these goals. These suggestions are meant to foster conversation and consideration by psychologists across all subfields and areas of focus.},

A natural ﬁeld experiment was conducted in a college dormitory system. Participants were White freshmen who had been randomly assigned to either a White or an African American roommate. Students participated in two sessions during the ﬁrst 2 and last 2 weeks of their ﬁrst quarter on campus. During these sessions, they answered questions about their satisfaction and involvement with their roommates and completed an inventory of intergroup anxiety and an implicit measure of racial attitudes. Participants in interracial rooms reported less satisfaction and less involvement with their roommates than did participants in same-race rooms. However, automatically activated racial attitudes and intergroup anxiety improved over time among students in interracial rooms, but not among students in same-race rooms. Thus, the results suggest that interracial roommate relationships, although generally less satisfying and involving than same-race roommate relationships, do produce beneﬁts.},

Aspects of the individual, the couple, and the work context, measured preadoption, were examined as predictors of gatekeeping. Gatekeeping refers to attitudes and behaviors aimed at regulating and limiting the involvement of the other parent in housework and child care and was measured 2 years postadoption. Findings revealed that women in heterosexual relationships reported higher gatekeeping compared with all other groups, and men in same-sex relationships reported higher gatekeeping compared with women in same-sex relationships and men in heterosexual relationships. Across the full sample, lower job autonomy predicted higher gatekeeping in both housework and child care, whereas greater relationship ambivalence, greater perceived parenting skill, and lower perceived partner parenting skill predicted higher gatekeeping in child care. Findings provide insight into how gatekeeping behaviors and beliefs are enacted in diverse types of couples and suggest that work factors should be taken into account when conducting research on, and seeking to improve, coparenting relationships.},

Using recent data from a national sample, the Survey of Marital Generosity ( N = 1,368 couples), we explored the associations between gender egalitarianism, familism, religiosity, and generous behavior among spouses aged 18 to 45. Our results suggest that domestic gender egalitarianism—where spouses reported sharing housework and child care—is linked to greater reports of marital generosity. Religiosity is also positively associated with marital generosity. Finally, the most potent predictor of generosity in this study is commitment, where spouses are personally dedicated to their partner and to continuing the relationship.},

Prior research has shown that these attitudes predict greater aggression toward female relationship partners, but has overlooked the contexts in which such aggression should occur. The present research identified an important contextual factor that determines when men’s hostile sexism is (and when it is not) associated with relationship aggression. Men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism were more aggressive toward their female partners during couples’ daily life (Study 1) and conflict discussions (Study 2), but only when their female partners were perceived to be, or reported being, low in relationship commitment. These findings show that men who endorse hostile sexism do not always enact aggression toward female partners, but do so in contexts relevant to their fears that women will exploit men’s relational dependence and undermine men’s power.},

The study aims to answer whether the women spend additional time on housework and are happier when they or their partner is teleworker. Also, we explore whether are happier when they share the household–domestic production with their partners. Fixed effects estimates take place, and we consider a Bayesian Network framework and a directed acyclic graph for causal inference. The results show that women are more likely to state that the household allocation, such as cooking, cleaning, ironing and childcare is shared when their partner teleworks. Shopping is an exception which can be regarded as an outdoor activity while one partner may be mainly responsible for this chore. In addition, women are happier when they or their spouse is teleworker, and they report higher levels of happiness when the household production allocation is a shared process. This may indicate men teleworkers may contribute extra to the household production releasing a burden for the partners and improving their well-being.

	abstract = {Profound changes in gender roles have taken place over the past several decades in the United States. Women’s roles have changed most: women are marrying later in life and at lower rates, having fewer children, and working more outside of the household. “Career women” are the new normal and housewifery has gone out of fashion. At the same time, women have become less happy. We use the {US} General Social Surveys from 1972 to 2014 to explore these latest trends. We find that, until recently, women were happier to be housewives or to work part-time than fulltime, especially, women who are older, married, with children, in middle or upper class, and living in suburbs or smaller places. The effect size of housewifery on subjective wellbeing ({SWB}) is mild to moderate, at about a fourth to a third of the effect of being unemployed. Therefore, we argue that one possible reason for the decline in average happiness for women was increased labor force participation. Yet, the happiness advantage of housewifery is declining among younger cohorts and career women may become happier than housewives in the future.},

We examine the associations between gender role attitudes, household labor, and family satisfaction. In addition, we include a measure of incongruence between ideology and behavior. We estimate individual, couple, and country factors and their association with family satisfaction in regression models, as well as variation within and between countries based on multi-level models. Overall, we find that involvement in housework and childcare is positively associated with family satisfaction. Family satisfaction is higher among those in more traditional relationships (man breadwinner, woman homemaker) relative to other family forms; yet interaction terms indicate that men report higher family satisfaction the more involved they are in housework and childcare, and the more they agree they ought to share housework and childcare. Although those in traditional partnerships report higher family satisfaction, nontraditional partners experience less incongruence between their attitudes regarding the division of labor in the home and actual behavior. Multi-level models indicate that only about 4 percent of the variation in family satisfaction is between countries, and satisfaction is associated with increased country development. Development and family policies that encourage and support father involvement in household responsibilities are likely to increase family satisfaction, even among couples in more traditional family roles; and this relationship appears to be consistent cross-nationally.

Data from 204 newly cohabiting Canadian heterosexual couples indicated that men and women perceived inequity to self and equity to self, respectively, when the distribution of time was equal at home, yet men spent more time on paid work or academics than their partners did. Moreover, men and women perceived equity to self and inequity to self, respectively, when women did the bulk of the housework and men spent more time on paid work or academics than their partners did. Results also revealed that women’s personal contribution is linked to their relationship satisfaction through self-use of equity-restoring strategies when their partners’ use of equity-resisting strategies is high. For men, the conditional indirect effect of personal contribution on relationship satisfaction was significant when their attempts to restore equity were met with low resistance from their partners. Overall, our results highlight gender differences that could help raise awareness around issues of housework inequality and inform the development of educational programs for romantic partners who face ongoing challenges of housework allocation.},

Further analyses show similar results for {PPS}, politicized racial identity, and political participation. Politicized gender identity mediated the relationship between {PPS} and women's rights activism, and politicized racial identity mediated the relationship between {PPS} and civil rights activism. {PPS} is demonstrated to independently predict political action and also to provide a personality link between group memberships, politicized collective identity, and political participation.},

The final scale, the Gender Role Beliefs Scale ({GRBS}), has strong internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Validity for the {GRBS} is demonstrated by large correlations with a criterion measure, significant mean differences among groups representing variations in traditionalism, and significant mean gender differences.
